620,"I don’t remember signing up for this. Maybe I did. I have no idea how long I have been here. Maybe I’ve always been here. The voice tells me to solve puzzles, so I do. The voice is not kind.
The cubes are my only companions. Some of them have hearts. Some of them scream. I try not to think about it.

I reach new heights, solve impossible puzzles... but it’s never enough. Each solution opens another door, and yet, the more I solve, the more I feel trapped. The game promises freedom, but does anyone truly escape?

I am either a genius or a very obedient lab rat. Possibly both.

620,"Ah, Portal 2. The portal gun is iconic. When platforming games and puzzle games are done well it can make for a very satisfying game but when they are both done well with a unique concept/mechanics.... *chef's kiss*

If you somehow don't know anything about the portal series, or if you're just considering trying it out, go for it. It is truly unique and iconic. OR, if you're like me and you have it but never finished it, I highly recommend you do so.

620,Portal 2 is one game I hesitated to get it but believe the reviews the game is super fun and challenging. Even in co op mode the levels are very intriguing there is no music just focus on the challenge with your friends.

620,"Portal 2 is a phenomenal continuation to the original Portal game. The sequel improves on the first game in every single aspect thus creating a perfect sequel to an already a original game with unique design and concept. Portal 2 is nothing but spectacular game which remains to be exceptionally fun and rewarding despite having no violence and just pure puzzle solving. Not only the the 2nd game improves on everything; gameplay, story, challenge/difficulty, soundtrack, and duration, the game also adds a whole new campaign for the co-op experience which is very interesting and more than welcome addition!",True,True,"Portal 2 phenomenal continuation original Portal game . sequel improves first game every single aspect thus creating perfect sequel already original game unique design concept .

620,"For me, Portal has always been such a fun puzzle game. The first time I played it was at a friend's house on their Xbox 360. I still remember sitting in their room, controller in hand, completely mesmerized by the concept of the portal gun. The way it allowed you to bend space, creating solutions that felt impossible at first glance, was unlike anything I had ever played before.

Back then, it was a game that I loved but couldn’t play for myself. I didn’t have the means to own a copy, so my experiences with it were limited to those moments at my friend’s house—short bursts of brilliance before I had to pass the controller back. Even so, Portal left an impression on me. It wasn’t just the puzzles that stuck with me; it was the atmosphere, the eerie silence of the test chambers, the cold yet strangely comedic presence of GLaDOS, and the subtle story that unfolded as you progressed.

When Portal 2 was announced, I was beyond excited. But once again, I faced the same problem—I couldn’t play it myself. Watching trailers and hearing people talk about it only fueled my anticipation. It wasn’t just a sequel; it was an expansion of everything that made the first game special. The humor was sharper, the story was richer, and the puzzles were more complex.

Eventually, I finally got the chance to play Portal 2, and it exceeded every expectation I had. The puzzles were nothing short of genius. While the first game introduced the mechanics and let players experiment, the sequel built upon that foundation with new elements like Excursion Funnels, Aerial Faith Plates, Hard Light Bridges, and the incredible Repulsion, Propulsion, and Conversion Gels. Each of these additions made the puzzles feel more dynamic and engaging, requiring players to think in new and creative ways.

Now, about the story… wait, Portal 2 had a story? You mean to tell me the game wasn’t just about flinging myself through portals and occasionally being called fat by a supercomputer? If you squint hard enough at the dialogue between test chambers, there’s apparently some kind of plot about an amnesiac, possibly brain-damaged silent protagonist (seriously, this woman has fallen so many times—how is she alive?) who wakes up in a decayed testing facility and immediately starts taking orders from a talking British eyeball. Said eyeball, despite being adorable and an absolute idiot, somehow sets off a chain of events that reawakens GLaDOS, the most passive-aggressive murder machine in history.

GLaDOS, being the forgiving and reasonable AI that she is, immediately decides to continue science by throwing Chell back into test chambers because, well, what else is she supposed to do? This goes on for a while until, for reasons I can’t quite recall (probably because Wheatley had a great idea), we end up in the backrooms of Aperture Science, where we discover that A) Cave Johnson had no business running a company, B) Caroline is GLaDOS, and C) we were never meant to be here, yet here we are. Meanwhile, the last few remaining human test subjects, who were miraculously still alive, are casually killed off-screen by GLaDOS, who treats it as nothing more than taking out the trash.

Then Wheatley, in a stunning display of zero thought, overthrows GLaDOS, turns evil for like… a few hours, and then tries to kill Chell by designing some of the worst test chambers imaginable (to be fair, the man was not programmed for this). GLaDOS, now a potato (yes, really), helps Chell take him down, and the whole thing ends with the most polite attempted murder I’ve ever seen as Wheatley is hurled into space while regretfully apologizing. The game then unceremoniously boots Chell out of Aperture Science forever—because after everything, they really just wanted her gone.

One of the best additions was the cooperative multiplayer mode. Playing as Atlas and P-Body, two testing robots, you and a friend had to solve puzzles that required teamwork and communication. The co-op campaign was filled with clever, sometimes brain-melting challenges that emphasized trust and coordination, making it one of the best cooperative experiences in gaming.

The soundtrack was subtle yet effective, creating an immersive atmosphere that shifted from eerie to energetic depending on the situation. The dynamic music that responded to player actions made solving puzzles even more satisfying. And, of course, the game gave us yet another unforgettable ending song—""Want You Gone,"" a perfect follow-up to Still Alive.

Despite being released in 2011, Portal 2 remains as fun and engaging as ever. The gameplay is timeless, the humor still hits, and the community-created test chambers add infinite replayability. Few games manage to balance story, gameplay, and innovation as effortlessly as Portal 2 does.

If you’ve never played Portal 2, you’re missing out on one of the most brilliant games ever made. It’s an experience that blends humor, challenge, and storytelling in a way that few games have ever achieved. Whether you’re solving puzzles solo, laughing at Wheatley’s antics, or working through co-op challenges with a friend, Portal 2 is an unforgettable ride from start to finish.

620,"S-tier, one of it's kinda game. I thank valve for adding native linux support to all their games. It ran perfectly on my system. 

There is a certain charm to the game. Maybe it's the ""goofy [spoiler] Wheatley [/spoiler] and the snarky GlaDos"" or the cute turrets or the amazing puzzles. 
The voice actors and dialogue/story writers did a marvellous job. They made the player feel that the robots are alive and gave an amazing personality to each of the characters. The level designers also did a great job at creating complex puzzles with a handful of mechanics. For some experienced players they might feel a bit too easy but I am sure that the Co-op and community made levels will satisfy their hunger for really hard brain challenging levels.

I have not played the Co-Op yet but I am looking forward to playing them as soon as possible. The game also has countless mods, if you are looking forward to buying this game I would like to suggest you to check out the Portal mods on steam after finishing the game if you would like to have MORE Portal!

620,"Here at Aperture Science we believe in unique mechanics, amazing storytelling, and top notch graphics. Portal 2 was and still is a very good game. It's easily one of the more replayable games out there. Thanks to the boys up in research development, there's always something you didn't notice before, or a way to solve a test that was different from the last time. Not only is the main story great, but the multiplayer Co-Op mode is loads of fun. Then there's the addition of community test chambers. There are so many great chambers out there, some even with their own custom story lines! Crowd Sourcing chambers was definitely the right direction! The game basically never ends! It's only over when your brain is fried from solving puzzles! Good one Caroline! All in all it's amazing game that will keep you engaged, and our investors happy.

620,"🚀 9/10 - Would solve mind-bending puzzles again! 🚀

Portal 2 is, without a doubt, one of the greatest games ever made. Valve took the innovative mechanics of the original Portal and expanded them into a full-fledged, unforgettable experience filled with ingenious puzzles, top-tier storytelling, and dark humor that never gets old.

🧩 Brilliant Puzzle Design: The portal gun is back, and with new mechanics like gels, light bridges, and excursion funnels, every chamber feels fresh and rewarding. The game does an incredible job of gradually introducing new elements while keeping the challenge engaging.

🎭 Unmatched Writing & Voice Acting: GLaDOS returns with her signature sarcastic wit, but the new characters—especially Wheatley (voiced by Stephen Merchant) and Cave Johnson (J.K. Simmons)—steal the show with hilarious, yet compelling dialogue. The storytelling is immersive, and the plot twists are genuinely jaw-dropping.

🎮 Co-op Mode = Pure Fun: The cooperative mode is a masterpiece in itself. Solving puzzles with a friend while laughing at their inevitable portal mishaps is an experience like no other. The teamwork and communication required make for some of the best multiplayer moments in gaming.

🏆 A Must-Play for Everyone: Whether you love puzzle games, rich storytelling, or just experiencing a game with some of the best writing in history, Portal 2 is an absolute must-play. Even after all these years, it remains a gold standard for game design.

620,"If you love solving puzzles you will love the game. If you come here to experience a single player story like me you will be disappointed.

The good:

Puzzle heaven, as the story progresses the game keeps adding new mechanics and gimmicks and things that interact with your portals to keep your mind engaged and add more challenge and variety to the tests.

Superb voice acting with witty dialogues full of passive aggressive jabs, unhinged company guidelines and macabre humor.

The same witty dialogues offer -some- exposition lore about the views and unethical experiments performed by the company Aperture, the unhinged and evil deeds of which can compete with the Vault-tech company of Fallout.

There is a co-op mode for friends to play together.

There is a level creator where you can build your own test chambers, and you can pick from a list and play test rooms created by other players.

Short chapters/test chambers with a good distribution of checkpoints locking in when you achieve a sub goal that will contribute to solving the main puzzle, so you don’t have to repeat the tests from the beginning if you mess up, accidentally jump to your death or die to a trap.

The Bad:

My main complaint is that the game focuses solely on the puzzle solving aspect and nothing else to the point it becomes detrimental to immersion and the story experience.

There is not enough lore to uncover, with only a specific chapter where you listen to prerecorded messages actually delivering a satisfying dose of lore and contributing to the world-building of the game.

Not enough secrets and interesting things to discover/interact with. I often found myself deviating from the correct path to explore a side room in hopes of discovering: a note, a memo, an old abandoned experiment set piece that was set aside, dead test subjects, other environmental story telling, or an extra quote from my robot companions making a new observation or offering me extra insight into their perspective as I enter an optional area. In most cases I found plain dead ends and empty rooms, generic set pieces of furniture I couldn’t interact with and vast empty fields cut off from the player by a broken bridge or chaircase. I found 3? secret rooms containing an abstract graffiti on them with no explanation about it and a few coffee mugs and that was it. Not even a comment from my companions and ai overlord about the graffity.

The short testing chambers that might be a plus for some, also means an endless amount of loading screens between the puzzles and sparse dialogues, something that further slows down the slugging and borderline non-existent plot progression to a standstill and breaks immersion.

In my opinion the puzzles on the later part become tedious rather than engaging, focusing on getting the right timing and quick reaction rather than critical thinking and outsmarting the test creator.

/ So, buy it if you love to solve environmental puzzles, but not if you are here to experience a story and are here for the story.

You can play so many custom made maps by others, most of which are mind-bending high quality puzzles.

620,"Beautiful sequel! It does not try to amp up the themes that were already masterfully developed in Portal. Instead it provides a flourishing variety of graphical styles and new gameplay that play homage to the first installment while providing a lot of fun and entertainment to the player. While the first game is dark and builds upon the oppressive feeling of loneliness and uncertainty, here you have talkative companions and you feel part of a story with a finale that is more and more anticipated. There is a fantastic comic relief in Wheatley and some psychological introspection about human nature with Glados/Caroline. Moreover the development of the character of Cave Johnson through the recordings and the framed portraits is subtle and remarkable. And the evolution of graphics and technology through the decades as you explore the old labs is really aesthetically pleasing. So in conclusion, really, really recommended game, brilliant and entertaining - just not as iconic, focused, and touching as the first one, which is a masterpiece.",True,True,"Beautiful sequel ! try amp themes already masterfully developed Portal .

The original Portal is fantastic but its short like an indie film and leaves you wanting more.  Portal 2 is that full length movie with the same cast, same beats, and just knocks it out of the park to become a cult classic.

Good voice acting, looks great considering it's more than a decade old, and on top of all of that, anybody can play this game.  When other games are recommended, they still have to appeal to that person's interest.

620,"Portal 2 is the game that got me to create a Steam account in the first place. I never was much of a fan of first person shooting games but with Portal, the emphasis was on puzzles and the shooting was ... well, portals. It was a great way to feel the gameplay of a genre I largely ignored. Once I realized there was a delightful story with hilarious dialogue, I was hooked. I had to go back and play the first game as well. I decided to start a new playthrough tonight as a friend and I have been playing the co-op mode on Switch recently.

Portal 2 is quirky fun that you have to experience. Once you've played the single-player game, you'll likely have fun with the two-player challenges as well. The only sad part is you're not going to get the wonderful story of the single-player experience. However, the two testing robots that you control are filled with personality. I often think of them as Bert and Ernie due to their size and shapes.

Hee hee.)",True,True,"Portal 2 game got create Steam account first place . never much fan first person shooting games Portal , emphasis puzzles shooting ... well , portals . great way feel gameplay genre largely ignored . realized delightful story hilarious dialogue , hooked . go back play first game well . decided start new playthrough tonight friend playing co-op mode Switch recently .

The simple art design and level layout ensure you have everything you need to solve the puzzle laid out in front of you, it’s purely down to you to use what you’ve learned and connect the abstract dots via the portal gun.

This time around the story to gameplay balance was perfect, whereas the first feels a little more like a pilot episode for this game. Loved the voice acting, witty writing and pacing, and absolutely nailed the ending for me which could have been easy to mess up.

Even though I could only play the game in small bursts, I loved every second of it. A truly immersive, enjoyable and innovative game that I’d recommend to anyone who hasn’t yet played it.

Portal 2 definitely doesn’t stray far from the original games feel, yet it has a lot of new features and differences to make the experience feel fresh.

However, this game had intuitive puzzle design that at times felt overwhelming, but when picked apart was really quite simple for the most part. I will say however that the test chambers were quite repetitive, and the segments outside of chambers were the parts that I enjoyed the most. It also felt like the game dragged on a little bit, but 4-5 hours really isn't terrible. I loved the character design and how each one was somewhat lovable/understandable in their own way (even though there were only 3 characters if you count the defects as 1 character). I feel like the game was somewhat lacking in protagonist character design, though, because it really just felt like our character was a vessel for the story to progress, when we should have been an interlocking part. I guess the game leaves it up to the player to be the protagonist's personality? Anyway, final sequence was clever and also somewhat heartwarming. I just love when games go and make their own lyrical soundtracks, it makes everything so much more cinematic (just take a look at Mirror's Edge!).

620,"Portal 2 – A Timeless Puzzle Masterpiece

Rating: ★★★★★ (10/10)

Valve’s Portal 2 is a game that sets the gold standard for puzzle-platformers. Building upon the innovative mechanics of its predecessor, this sequel delivers a masterful blend of challenging puzzles, dark humor, and an unforgettable story.

Gameplay & Mechanics
At its core, Portal 2 retains the iconic portal gun, allowing players to create interconnected portals to navigate mind-bending test chambers. The game introduces new elements like Excursion Funnels, Repulsion and Propulsion Gels, and Light Bridges, which expand puzzle complexity and variety. The difficulty progression is smooth, ensuring players feel challenged without frustration.

Story & Atmosphere
The game’s narrative is as engaging as its gameplay. You reprise the role of Chell, navigating the ruined Aperture Science facility, guided (and taunted) by the ever-sarcastic AI, GLaDOS. The introduction of Wheatley, a bumbling yet hilarious personality core, adds depth and comedy to the experience. The voice acting, especially from Stephen Merchant and Ellen McLain, is phenomenal.

Multiplayer & Replayability
Beyond the fantastic single-player campaign, the co-op mode introduces an entirely new experience. Playing as Atlas and P-Body, you and a friend must rely on teamwork and communication to solve intricate puzzles. The game also supports community-made test chambers, giving it nearly infinite replay value.

Graphics & Soundtrack
Despite being released in 2011, Portal 2 still holds up visually, thanks to its art direction and atmospheric lighting. The soundtrack, composed by Mike Morasky, perfectly complements the game’s sci-fi setting, enhancing both tension and excitement.

Verdict
Portal 2 is not just a game—it’s an experience. With its perfect blend of clever puzzles, immersive storytelling, and co-op fun, it remains one of the greatest games of all time. Whether you're a first-time player or returning for another round of testing, Aperture Science is always worth the visit.

Final Score: 10/10 – A must-play for puzzle and story lovers alike!

I'm insanely late to the party, but I finally finished Portal 2, and it's as good as everyone says. Even now, in 2025, Portal 2 is one of if not arguably the best puzzle game of all time. Portal 1 is great in it's own right, but Portal 2 succeeds in every aspect at improving on it's predecessor. More mechanics, deeper puzzles, better characters, better story, better action, pretty much everything you could think of. 

The main thing to note about Portal 2 is that it is, in my opinion, a masterclass in video game design. While I noted that the game has more mechanics, they actually only added a few; the difference is that they are all of the utmost quality. It's really easy for sequels to get caught in the ""more"" trap and just go on a rampage of adding things for the sake of it, but the reason why it works in Portal 2 is that everything is added in the context of everything else. This is one of the best examples of ""less is more"" in gaming. Every mechanic is intuitive, fun, and incredibly simple in isolation. Adding everything together is what gets things really going. They have also mastered introducing new mechanics to the player. It typically goes like (show player what mechanic looks like -> allow player to test mechanic and figure out what it does -> force player to apply mechanic in a specific way -> way of using mechanic is added to their pool of knowledge -> add to that and make them combine everything in various ways to complete tests). It's incredibly rewarding and does a great job of easing you into each new trial.

As a side note, I already briefly mentioned it, but it's incredible how well Portal 2 holds up today. Granted it's not THAT old, but it's still impressive. I can only guess that it's Valve's excellent art direction that has allowed it to survive the seemingly exponential progression in graphics and technology in general. It's like Mirror's Edge or some of Valve's other games like TF2 in that respect. Portal 2 isn't trying to have cutting edge realistic graphics for what it would be in 2011, but it instead focuses on aesthetic, colour, and general art direction first. There isn't anything inherently wrong with trying to push your game into photo-realism, but if you want it to visually last, you need to take a page out of Valve's book.

Story wise, like I said, it's great as well. I went in blind, and the game felt like a real adventure all around. I enjoyed the characters, their arcs, the environments, the conclusion, all that good stuff. I don't really have much to say other than that, partly because I don't want to spoil anything, but also because it's just... good. Not life changing, but it's enjoyable from start to finish.

TL;DR: Portal 2 still holds up now and you should go play it.",True,True,"really n't necessary since 's literally Portal 2 , yeah , game awesome .

The humor in this game is gold. Wheatley, that little robot with the British accent, had me cracking up constantly. I don't know why a robot needs a British accent, but it just makes everything funnier. The story is surprisingly engaging, and the characters are well-developed. It's like a Pixar movie, but with more portals and less crying (though, I admit, I did feel a pang when I accidentally incinerated a Companion Cube).

The gameplay is something else. Figuring out how to manipulate the environment with the portals is incredibly satisfying. ""Speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out"" becomes your mantra as you're launching yourself across the levels. And just when you think you've got it figured out, they throw gels, lasers, and light bridges into the mix. It's a constant learning curve, but never frustrating.

I even got my sister to play the co-op mode with me, and it was a blast. Twice the portals means twice the brainpower, and let me tell you, we needed it. Solving those puzzles together was actually a bonding experience, which is more than I can say for most of our family game nights.

Honestly, Portal 2 is just a beautifully designed game. It makes you think outside the box[3], and it's funny as hell while doing it. If you haven't played it yet, do yourself a favor and pick it up.

620,"Man portal 2 is such a great game! !!!!1 !! 1 1 1 111 1! !1!!!!!!11! ! !! !!! ! ! ! ! ! ! 1 The game's design is great and does a good job of building on the features of the first portal while shaking things up with new and unique features. While the first portal's levels are more focused around the portal gun, portal 2's levels focuses on other unique gimmicks and how they interact with the portal gun. Some of these include the light bridge thingies, the propulsion, repulsion, and the conversion gels, and the excurscisong tunnel blue thing. All of these mechanics feel fresh and pair really well with the portal gun, adding a new layer of depth to portal 2's levels. Portal 2 also has a much deeper plot and better writing than the original portal, with the puzzles being more focused on story progression. The game explores the history and origins of Aperture science and introduces wheatly the Bri ish guy. Wheately is a really funny character because he is Bri ish an d he is really stupid. This game also has a co-op mode which I haven't played because I have no friends, so that is cool and different from the first game. In conclusion, this game heavily builds on what has already been established in the first game, and introduces new and interesting mechanics while polishing the old ones.

[h1]TLDR:[/h1]
[b]A textbook example of how to make a sequel to an already great game.[/b]


If the first one blew you away...this is going to blow you up to the moon. It takes everything the first portal did and made it better and gave it a fresh coat of paint.


[h1]Positive:[/h1]

[b]Story and lore:[/b]
While the first one was stronger on the gameplay side, Portal 2 has alot more to offer on both story, lore and gameplay side. The game has a more fleshed out story about the history of aperture science and glados. You get to see behind the scenes of the enrichment center and uncover it's secrets that are hidden deep below the surface. Im not gonna say much more. Go play it. Now.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
The portal gun returns of course. So do the cube puzzles. There are lasers now which you can control with the portals and a cube that can redirect the laser. There are jump pads that let you fly through the air. Again, Im not gonna say much more since encountering those elements for the first time is part of the fun. If you think you've seen all kinds of elements portal could offer, you'd be dead wrong.

[b]Music:[/b]
Portal 1 had an eerie atmospheric soundtrack which fit the game perfectly. Portal 2 soundtrack is more varied. Not so atmospheric anymore. It uses a mixture of synths and orchestral instruments to create very good tracks. The music is not static. It reacts to the players actions. The song adds an element when you fly through the air for example. It sounds like science.


[h1]Negative:[/h1]

[b]None:[/b]
This game is flawless. There is nothing that should be added or removed.


[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]

The Portal series is an incredible piece of science fiction. Do we need a Portal 3? Yes of course. Even though, it felt like the story is kind of over with portal 2. There was no cliffhanger like in the Half-Life series. Portal for me is how video games are meant to be. You play it, you enjoy it, you maybe even play it again. No massive open world, no slop quests, no 100h story, no microtransactions or constant updates. Im tired of this. Just give me a finished game, let me play it and im good.",True,True,"[ h1 ] Rating : 10/10 -Masterpiece [ /h1 ] [ h1 ] TLDR : [ /h1 ] [ b ] textbook example make sequel already great game .

620,"Puzzles! Puzzles! Also, frustratingly, annoyingly, maddeningly, PUZZLES!!! That's the game. If you don't like puzzles, this game isn't for you.

If you DO like puzzles, this game is ABSOLUTELY for you! The New York Crossword can't hold a candle to the crap this game comes up with. Spatial thinking is key. You have to, literally, think within a three (possibly 4) dimensional space. Up is down, left is right, right is wrong, etc. The puzzles contained herein will challenge everything you have ever conceived of as a puzzle. 

If you're familiar with the artist MC Escher, imagine his paintings brought to life, in a three dimensional space. Now, imagine you have a gun that can take you from any point in said painting, to any other point in said painting. That's the core of the game.

Besides that, it's also a hilarious, campy adventure to get out of a crazy dungeon. The voice acting absolutely superb (anyone that has seen TBBT might recognize Wheatly's voice). GlaDos is simply a gentle, angry bitch; all she wants to do is TEST! I think J. Jonah. Jameson makes an appearance. 

All in all, this is truly an amazing game. You can spend hundreds of hours enoying and/or hating it. Either way, you'll still love it. I first played it on Xbox, and once I saw it on Steam, the purchase was a no-brainer.

440,"I once thought of TF2 as one of if not my favorite game of all time, but considering the fact that since before I even started playing the game, Valve has been neglecting the game, the Meet Your Match update single handedly implementing a system that facilitated the bot crisis that has plagued the game from 2018-2024.

I want you to take the time and think, if a game like Call of Duty, R6 Siege, or Marvel Rivals basically remade their entire matchmaking system to a point to where the game itself is so overrun with cheaters and bots that you can't get into a match for YEARS on end, the developers of the game in question would be publicly humiliated and nobody would buy a game from them again.

If any Valve employee reads this review, please for the love of god do not make the same mistakes with Deadlock as you have with TF2.

440,"After playing the game for several thousand hours across multiple accounts, my first time starting back in 2013 I can safely say that back then I would've recommended it.  However in 2025 I can't say the same.  No game in history has been so thoroughly abused as Team Fortress 2 has been, and will continue to be.

Any other game making tens of MILLIONS a year would expect to see very adamant developer support, yet TF2 sees absolutely nothing save for them adding a few pieces of community made content a year.  No balance changes, no updates, nothing.   

A shocking amount of reviews give praise at them handling the bot crisis (which made casual quite literally unplayable for nearly 9 entire years) and give the game a positive review.  Those people are wrong, and far too generous.  If Portal had a bug where you couldn't click the play button in the main menu thus keeping the game unplayable, you wouldn't praise them for fixing it, it'd be an expectation of them to keep their game in a playable state.  The community owes it to the game and themselves to be FAR more critical of valves rampant and shameless neglect of this game.

To draw an ugly comparison, Fallout 76 is currently more updated and more developed than TF2, despite making a fraction as much in yearly revenue.  Fallout 76, was 2018's biggest gaming laughing stock, yet is currently being updated and developed better than TF2. 

It deserves much better than this, and frankly the communities constant positivity towards valve for providing less than the bare minimum disgusts me.  Seemingly forgetting 8 years of it being unplayable as soon as the game is acknowledged even slightly by valve.  Any other game would be beyond blessed for such a forgiving community, yet at ever possible chance valve takes the TF2 community for granted, happy to siphon their money but completely unwilling to listen to them unless it makes it's way to the mainstream media. (Remember, the only reason valve even addressed the bots was because they spammed slurs and media outlets picked up on this.  Valve simply responded by making free accounts unable to chat, ALL free accounts including innocent players.  Then once they'd hit the mute button they continued to let the bots run wild)

Until the game recieves the proper care it deserves I can't in good faith give it a positive review.  Nothing short of getting a true team of developers and active communication towards valve is acceptable.  Even in the event this is achieved the years of neglect won't go away, nor should the community EVER let them forget about it.

Such an amazing game that is neglected by Valve, it saddens me to say this.
This game doesn't get (truly) updated, it receives band-aids to create illusions that something is getting better, but the disaster that was Meet your match has made it into a bot infested hellscape that was only recently fixed, which doesn't justify the years of neglect (neglect that is still happening) whilst offering this product as ""playable"" to the potential players that will become buyers through microtransactions.
It is clear that Valve keeps it alive on life support because it still makes them money, which is unfortunate because it allows them to neglect one of the best FPS games ever made without many consequences.
It IS an amazing game, but it is factually dead, a zombie just coasting through the world trying to fit in amongst the living. 
Valve (not just one good Samaritan at Valve) needs to start making REAL updates - revert Meet your match (for example), create new content (real content like new weapons, gamemodes or maps designed by them) OR just finally admit (which they never will) that this game's purpose is to slowly fade out of existence whilst making another 10 million a year for them so that they give us the illusion that the things players spent money on in ALL of their games is worth spending and will last (which it won't and cannot).

The only real way to enjoy this game is through community made servers. Why bother giving this company money when it will do next to nothing to uplift their active flagship title? Why not throw 1 million dollars out of the billions they have into a dedicated, contracted team to keep their game up-to-date and running correctly?

440,"[b]tl;dr:[/b] F2P players must scream but have no mouths anymore. There's still only 4 class tutorials out of 9. The 2016 ""Meet Your Match"" update gutted a very fine (but not perfect, mind you) casual matchmaking system, Quickplay, for an inferior bot-abused half-baked e-sport oriented one. Still had a great deal of chaotic TF2 fun but [i]I'm very disappointed in Valve[/i].

I'll preface this that despite what my game info might tell, I had another account where I had +4500 hours on the game.
I started around 2010 with some of my friends, one community Orange map server was one of our regular hangouts for years. Lots of laughs and good late night memories. Fond times.
Loved the game, it's chaotic and friendly atmosphere. Cosmetics were a nice plus as you still could chat normally while being F2P.
Quick play came along and was nice for jumping in without thinking too much.

Life and school does its thing, I get very busy in 2015 and boom it's late 2024. I lost my previous account.
I decide to jump back on TF2, join a game through the new matchmaking system named ""Casual Play"" and..
[list]
  [*]I can't even call medic OR chat while F2P?!
  [*]I can't even switch teams at a whim?! Even when the other team is bleeding player because they get stomped? And I can't vote scramble?!!!!
  [*]I can't extend map time anymore?!
  [*]I can't join official Valve servers with the server browser anymore?!
  [*]The nice community & Valve server UI search with settings is gone?!
  [*]I can only have 6 friends in my party?!!
[/list]

Despite all that I still had amazing interactions and good time fragging, but seeing those good features taken for granted ripped out felt like a kick in the nuts especially the ""F2P not allowed to chat or call for Medic"" one.
At least, I got back when the great majority of bot and cheaters got banned. I can't even begin to imagine what the experience was for new players for years outside of community servers.

I could recommend this game if :

  [*]Quickplay came back
  [*]F2P players have their mouth back.
  [*]An actual full tutorial for each class would be great for newbies.

440,"'Team Fortress 2' is a video game that I DO NOT RECOMMEND to other players.

As a player who has spent more than 2000 hours practicing and playing in this video game throughout multiple different Steam accounts, I have slowly but surely started to lose my originally rose-tinted perception of Team Fortress 2 and started to see many of its flaws.

Human players that use cheating/hack software (colloquially referred to as 'cheaters/hackers'), automated player bots that use cheating/hack software (colloquially referred to as 'bots') and players who actively support cheaters/hackers and bots make up a non-negligible portion of the game's playerbase.

Team Fortress 2 (colloquially referred to as 'TF2') has been neglected/abandoned by its developers (Valve Corporation/Software). There are still many unfixed bugs/exploits in the game, though only some of them are potentially game-breaking/unfair. TF2 has yet to receive a major update in more than 8 years (at the time of writing; 2 February 2025).

The community of TF2 is generally an echo chamber for extremely toxic/hostile/aggressive/rude individuals that also seem to be addicted to toxic positivity.

TF2 is an extremely old video game with many veterans who have played the game for more than a decade; making joining TF2 as a new player extremely challenging as most players would be constantly killed repeatedly. TF2 requires players to sink at least a few dozen hours practicing mechanics in order to not be an absolute burden to their teammates or to not die repeatedly. Additionally, TF2 is not popular so players oftentimes will meet the same fate over and over again or struggle to even join a server that is not empty.

However, TF2's plethora of official and community-made content/media in the form of recordings of gameplay footage, guides, documentaries, short videos, series of animated films and even entire movies are still quite enjoyable to this day, though they usually depict TF2 in its former glory days (about 2007-2018).

In conclusion, Team Fortress 2 is now an unpleasant shell of its former self that will likely remain stagnant or perhaps even worsen for the rest of its lifespan.",False,True,"'Team Fortress 2 ' video game RECOMMEND players . player spent 2000 hours practicing playing video game throughout multiple different Steam accounts , slowly surely started lose originally rose-tinted perception Team Fortress 2 started see many flaws .

440,"Team Fortress 2 is a classic team-based shooter from Valve that’s been popular since its release in 2007. Featuring nine distinct classes, each with unique abilities, the game promotes teamwork and strategy. Its cartoony art style and humorous characters add charm, setting it apart from other FPS games.

Despite its age, TF2 remains fresh thanks to regular updates and community-created content. While occasional issues with bots and cheaters can be frustrating, Valve has continued to support the game over the years.

Overall, Team Fortress 2 is a fun, fast-paced game that still stands out in the multiplayer genre, offering great replay value for both newcomers and veterans alike.

440,"After playing this game on and off for over a decade (even though the playtime wouldn’t really suggest it), I have come to the conclusion that this game should be taken off life support, something Valve would obviously celebrate, as evidenced by complete disregard of the player base time and time again.

Team Fortress 2 is so, so painfully a product of its time, where “its time” is every single time Valve pushed out a large update. We got cosmetics (also limited-time ones, given for arbitrary reasons) and microtransactions, then matchmaking and some perverse version of achievements with rewards (Jungle Inferno contracts, anyone?) Finally, we settled on rampant cheating. If I could, I would instead write a review on Valve Anti-Cheat, but here we are…

Botting on TF2 got so bad that it was impossible to play, which is something that Valve doesn’t care about anymore if there’s profit in there somewhere. It was only after the community rallied together that Valve “fixed” the issue, but, to this day, if you play long enough and pay enough attention, you will run into more “subtle” cheaters every few games, because commercial solutions exist to cater to such audiences (see: LMAOBOX). Valve’s “anti-cheat” can be completely bypassed by existing open-source code snippets, leading us back to the point that TF2 is truly a product of its time, where basic detection techniques were good enough and everything else past that was duct-taped on top. Now, with the game being maintained by a skeleton crew, there is simply no hope of the situation ever improving. There might be further instances of grand ban waves, but, in the end, it's a war of attrition that Valve will lose.

Taking a small detour on to other things stemming from the game’s age - if you’ve played Quake about as long as TF2, you’ll be experiencing a familiar aura of “the meta must not be broken” throughout several game modes (“ye intel shalt not be capped” in CTF and “thou shalt not suck” in Mann Up), not to mention getting destroyed by players with thousands upon thousands of hours spent playing, who may or may not be cheating. Despite all that, there are always new players to be found. Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, they try to have fun in whatever way they see fit, but the more grizzled veterans know that having newbies in your team means getting stomped in a match.

“Why?”, you ask, “doesn’t the matchmaking system use some sort of rating to balance things out? Aren’t teams rebalanced if someone leaves or joins?”

440,"Only played this game for the first time 2 years ago and I still play it now. Its a great game in my opinion. A game which i feel is still a great game that competes with the many others on PC. This is the only shooter i haven't hated or gotten bored of and that's rare if you know me.

I like how this game works compared to others out there. The characters and weapons that come with them as different classes is good but how Team Fortress does it, its just the best I've played. There's plenty of game modes and the community is relatively good.
Cheaters keep becoming less common and same goes for them bots. Haven't seen one of them in a while and if you don't know what I'm on about its the bots that constantly promote cheeky websites and gambling sites and sometimes played strange noises, They also had aim bot but that's besides the point. 
There is no skilled based matchmaking but tbf i have never had an issue with that. I feel like you always have fair enough opponents. I must say though that new players will struggle at first with finding points. I always recommend you try training and fight some bots on different game modes. The bots are actually pretty good to practice with in the beginning to find what characters or classes you like. This game can also be good fun with friends, if you rock like a heavy-medic duo or something like that.
One last thing about this game is you need to buy something to unlock the chat feature and competitive. This unlocks your account and you may think this is an awful thing but its really not. It can stop some cheaters and players who are there to troll and annoy others. Plus the things you can buy in the game are cheap anyways like basic keys are only striking around 2 pound now a days and that's the same in dollars.

A few minutes do need to be devoted to changing the settings and optimization, and actually getting the hang of the classes takes a bit of time since the in-game tutorial's pretty bad.

440,"I have been in the loop with this game for at least a decade. I don't play it as often as I would like to, but if you were to see the problems and abuse the game truly has had over ninety percent of that span, then you would see exactly why it would drive even the most hardcore of comp players away for so long. It is still depressing to see just how lazy the developers were to the point where they decided to put the source code into the SDK in the 2/18/2025 update. I'll come back once Team Fortress 2 Classic properly launches as a mod later this year, but for the base game itself, a decade ago I would have recommended it for anyone to get into.

Time passes and a lot of things do change. I still have a heart for this masterpiece of an FPS shooter, but it was just the incompetence, laziness, abandonment and poor treatment the game got with barely any updates to show for, which also meant no weapon balances for an example.  These days, it's rare for me to get on this. At least three times a year I do play for about two weeks minimum before hanging the phone up, but that's still a lot of hours I can put in compare to the others that had to cold turkey the game after the long mistreatment it was receiving.

440,"hands down... the best video game ever made.  Just look at how many hours I got on record of this game

has some technical issues and some unpolished areas and outdated a bit But none the less the PROs OUT WEIGH the cons, it's very fun.

and if you're interested about what the CONs are...

1. The game's tutorial only teaches you about 4 of the classes you can play as. (there are 9) And it generally does a poor job at being a tutorial, it misses a lot of points and very important details that you'll need. It never tells you what said button does what. So I recommend looking up online, maybe a video!

2. The game suffers from really bad performance, the developers didn't put as much optimization work. So if you have a weak old computer you're gonna have to down a performance config online I recommend Mastercomfig as it provides the best performance and chose your preset that suits you. Medium high is good enough. And hell even if you have a good computer you're still gonna need mastercomfig

3. The game has issues with balance. It still does a good job at balancing everything there is. but there are weapons that are just quite literally very useless. And the sniper class if you're really really good at aiming, is very powerful in open maps he can destroy a lobby as a headshot can instantly kill about 5/9 of the classes.
The medic has an unlockable healing gun called the Vaccinator. If you're good at using it, then oh boy is it really powerful as well
And The engineer notably has two frustrating to fight against unlockables called the Wrangler and short circuit which is quite unblanced. The wrangler doesn't take much effort or work, by simply pressing 2 or switching to the wrangler your turret triples it's health and you have full control over it. And the short circuit is heavily spammable, each alt-fire shot takes away 65 of the engineer's metal (he can hold up to only 200 at max) and it shoots this spherical projectile energy that is also blinding and if any explosive projectiles are also around it's space it'll disintegrate them to ash basically deleting them.
All of these issues are commonly the problems TF2 players face, as it's frustrating to fight against what I talked about.

4. The game match maker is bad. Just watch Zesty jesus's ""TF2: You Will (Not) Play"" video about why it's bad 
(skip to 2:25:20)

5. The developers abandoned the community, the game is no longer getting good quality content updates. only on Summer or holidays to which it only brings more maps that can either be bad or decent and more hats which are finally starting to have better quality as before it was a bunch of slop and repetitive content that doesn't even fit the game's theme and art style

6. If you want to do game communications either mic-voice talk or do class voicelines or type in chat. You need to have a verified steam account meaning you bought a game that is 4$+ or bought a TF2 Item for 4$+ you'll be able to talk

7. There are cheaters and the anti-cheat is doing a bad job at preventing, cheaters destroying games (as of writing this, I haven't encountered a cheater in a while ever since valve's new moderation of actually starting to ban cheaters, we still don't know if this is handled automatically by a system or by human

440,"Good Character design, MOSTLY good weapon design, cosmetics are either designed ASS or actually good, the casual Match making system is NOT that good because of how slow the valve servers allow people to join games were people left (But it is the most played mode in the game), communitty servers are mostly dead but the most servers that are alive have toxic admins or are all in all just bad (I don't want to name any names here.) The community is a 2 sided blade 50% are the most tolerant and friendly people you've ever seen and the other 50% are toxic, edgy and bad people who ruin the entire communyties image. If you wan't to buy any items on the game use thirdparty sites because the valve shop ingame scamms you, but when youre searching for sites use safe ones that dont try to scamm anything out of you. The mechanics in this game are wonderfull and fun to play with, also if you see someone suspiciously hitting you it could be the games goofy hitboxes so it maybe is not a cheater, but the game is house of some closet cheaters. The game has sadly been abandoned by valve. (If you want more information about that go to youtube channels like ""Zesty Jesus"". 

To conclude: The game is a must play and you should try it, if youre new the lerning spann of the game will be mostly short to medium. (Well so was it for me.)

440,"In 2008 I bought Team Fortress 2 for the first time, and that was the beginning of a real gaming story, full of bright emotions, funny moments and a warm community. From the first minutes I was struck by the stylish cartoon-inspired visual design and unique gameplay, where each class is a separate universe with its own character and mechanics. 
As time went on, TF2 only blossomed. Updates like “The Sniper vs. Spy Update” or the legendary ‘Mann-Conomy’ not only added new weapons, but also expanded the lore of the game, filling it with humor and crazy plots. Team Fortress 2 is not just a game, but a phenomenon that unites millions of players around the world.
Thank you, Valve, for this masterpiece. For a game that has become home to millions of players. For emotions that don't fade even after a decade. Team Fortress 2 is a timeless classic, and I'm glad to be a part of its story.

440,"""The most fun you can have online."" - PC Gamer

Was thinking about leaving a meme review here, but I think a honest review might actually be more appropriate. Let me just get the general point out of the way; This game is amazing, and you'll never find another game like it. Seriously. There are several classes to pick from. Scout prefers rushing the enemy, using movement to his advantage and dodging the enemy's attacks while getting up close and personal. Soldier caters to anyone who likes dealing a lot of damage, but still wants lots of mobility. Pyro is good for ""men who just want to see the world burn."" You can hop into a server, brand new to the game, and terrorize the enemy team. While he has his fair share of mechanics that certainly take practice, I'd say Pyro is a easy-to-pickup, effective class (and the preferred choice for most new players.) Demoman, similar to soldier, caters to people who like taking an explosive approach with a sprinkle of mobility. You can just lay explosives everywhere and watch as the enemy team explodes into pieces like legos. The heavy is a tank, and will lead lots of pushes and be the prime target for Uber-Charges, which we'll go over later. He has a large health pool, does lots of damage, but this is all at the cost of Heavy's mobility. Engineer is great for players who want the best of both worlds. A support role, and a defense (and occasionally offense) role. His mounted sentry guns prove incredibly effective at area-denial, his dispensers provide health and ammo quickly to any teammates that need it, and his teleporters help keep the pressure on the enemy team by providing a quick path from spawn to the front lines. Medic is the purest form of support class. His main utility is his Medi-Gun, which can heal teammates at impressive rates. On top of this, after a certain amount of healing he will have a special attack. These range from types of Medi-Guns, but most of them provide invulnerability or upper hand over the enemy team in some form for a limited period of time. Sniper is great for picking off enemies for your team while they are leading a push, and chances are you'll be the first to spot most enemies. It keeps the pressure off of your team and can be a crucial part of a victory. And last, but not least, spy. Being possibly the most unique out of all the 9 classes, the spy has the ability to go invisible for a limited time, disguise as members of the enemy team, disable the enemy engineer's buildings, and instantly kill any enemies with a swift stab to the back. He uses these tools to get behind the enemy, and similarly to sniper, relieves pressure from your team.

Now that you have a brief description of the 9 classes, let's get to the more miscellaneous things that make this game special. Starting with the art style. I believe Team Fortress 2's art style has single-handedly influenced dozens of other games. Its cartoony nature provides a comedic environment. The game also has taunts, being one of the first of its kinds to do so. Many pair these taunts with something called kill binds. For example, if someone were to high-five you, they would press a button causing them to instantly die upon their hands' impact. The humor in this game is also great. The mercenaries all have unique personalities. The voice-lines can create comedic conversations, and there are so many mechanics to learn in this game. There are even sub-classes, which is a combination of a classes items to completely change it's game-play. All the different game-modes are unique to each other. While the main ones focus on teamwork, others like Medieval Mode are not very serious but can provide lots of entertainment. And would you look at that, I've gone and written a whole essay. I hope this gives a better idea of why this game is so special to so many people, and why it changed my perspective on games as a whole, but honestly If I tried to cover everything about this game we'd be here all day.

MvM: Mann versus machine. You and five others team up to defend a base from ai-controlled robot armies, with being able to upgrade yourselves based on how well you perform. You'll earn weapons, robot parts, and killstreak kits that make your weapons glow or shine, or give you special effects. If you're extremely lucky, you might even get a golden weapon.

Custom Servers: Well, this is where the crazy comes in. How about instead of 16v16, we do 50v50? or maybe 1 really strong dude with superpowers versus 31 regular guys? maybe you'd like to experience risk of rain in Team Fortress 2? or, you know what? maybe you'd like to play an adventure game like ocarina of time. Or a tower defense? what about prop hunt? a clicker game? maybe you want to run around as a guy half the normal size doing the conga and collecting coins secretly to make yourself stronger?

440,"TF2 is a really fantastic game. Most hero-objective shooters find there basis within this title. Every class is incredibly unique and the way it handles hit-scan combat is entirely separate from any shooter you will ever play. To utilize a character to it's fullest requires actually skill, thought process, positional understanding, and a degree of humbleness. Someone can always best you regardless of the class they are playing or the loadout they're using. It never takes itself too seriously as there is an onslaught of wacky weaponry,  random crits, and lenient spawning that make it sort of lighthearted and less sweaty. There is no team deathmatch; to win is to take an objective and that is endlessly refreshing. Taking an objective feels like traditional trench warfare. Your team establishes a position, takes an advantage, and tries to push against the other side who is also doing the same. This game has maintained a community since 2007 which is saying something.
That being said, besides this games uncomparable design, this game's developer is Valve. In 2010, with the introduction of the Mann-conomy update, Valve ruined an entire generation of games. This is one of the most widely known instances of Crate Economy. Crate economy is digital NFT gambling before NFTs existed. You find a crate, you buy a key, and you get a random useless cosmetic to show your friends you are willing to put more down on the game. This allows children to actually gamble, which is illegal. Plus its without all of the laws in place on fair gambling. By around 2012-2013 Steam introduced Steam Marketplace, a secondary market which you could trade these items with other players for Steam cash value at a taxed rate. Yes, this idea already existed in several MMORPGS. BUT here's the caveat, ""illegal"" (illegalized by terms and agreement's bonds made by company's when signing up for a game) secondary markets were affordable and you paid for the direct value of the work put into the game itself. It allowed dedicated players to access a free market for video games that often times required way too much actually time for something that was totally virtual. A product that had no form, function, or bearing in the real world. This marketplace would encourage a game's community by giving value to the amount of time spent in the title. Now here's where I wrap it back to Steam Marketplace.
Valve didn't have an MMORPG. They had a team shooter. Typically in 2000s MMORPGS these aftermarket items would have some bearing or use in the game that was beneficial. There became an uptick trend around 2007 for these aftermarket items to be purely cosmetic and limited time restricted. Valve saw this and wanted a piece of the pie. Crates, conceptually, is a lose-lose deal for the buyer. The buyer spends 2.50 for a key in game, the key does nothing except access limited items, and the items can only be sold or traded for other Steam inventory items. The 2.50 put down is lost and the only money gained is within the context of Steam. The only way around this is through game keys, which are sold on the aftermarket to make games that are more expensive on Steam cheaper. Now here's where it gets good:
Steam taxes 12% on any marketplace sale that happens. So if you bought a key at 2.50 and want to get rid of it, Steam makes 30 cents off the sale of such. Even with you purchasing this NFT, Steam always keeps a portion of the process. Here's a basic principle in economics, why change something if it provides you more income than the initial merchandise. So, with the usage of a model created by game players, Steam successfully monopolized video games and their micro-economics as a whole. This being done without the creation of new games or innovative features. 
They simply made so much money off this one concept every Triple A Industry Developer was forced to copy this model. PC Gaming quickly became the only way to develop a title. No other Marketplace was able to compete with the resounding popularity of Steam's platform, nor the capabilities of it, nor could they afford to even support themselves because Valve could simply buy them out.
So because of this one update what did Steam focus it's platforms usage on besides it's own meta economy? Data collection. Steam harvests so much data from your computer. Look at Steam Webhelper's data usage on a monthly basis. Valve knows everything about you, from the medications you take, to your relationships, to your work, to your insecurities, to what you find funny. It runs constantly in the background gathering every little bit of who you are. Why? You may have wanted to find enjoyment within these titles and find an escape from the world because it's cold and wicked. It may have given you hope that you could give someone a brand new type of experience that they couldn't get from the real world. Relationships with people you'd never meet, ideas you'd never see. Guess what? It's gone. Because of crates. Literally NFT crates.
As a side note, THEY DON'T EVEN MAKE THE CONTENT FOR THIS GAME ANYMORE. THE COSMETICS? FAN-MADE. MAPS? FAN-MADE. GAMETYPES? FAN-MADE. THE COMMUNITY MAKES IT AND VALVE SCORES THE CASH THAT IS HOW BACKWARDS THIS WHOLE SYSTEM IS.
They removed custom matchmaking. They haven't updated VAC Anti-cheat in forever, CS-GO 2 and 1 still see this problem, even while being the most popular game today. Hackers are all over the place. These same hackers if provoked could use multiple fake accounts to get you legit banned. The last update to add mechanically new weapons was in 2017. That's a whapping 7 years since they added anything functionally new. The in-game economy is still there and thriving, you can find certain items for thousands of real dollars. Every. Single. Holiday. They release new cosmetics. Every year new crates with new skins. 
TF2: I give it a 10/10. It was one of my favorite games ever growing up. It was a beacon of what a team shooter could look like and still be fun.
Valve: not on the scale. Actual privacy violating demons of individuals. Valve is an information gang. I don't say that lightly. If you are young and looking to play a classic and you read this review. Stop. Playing. Video games.

440,"There are video games, and then there is Team Fortress 2. To call it a game is a disservice—it is a way of life, a sacred text, a digital pantheon where gods of war battle in an eternal, blood-soaked ballet. And among them, one figure stands above all. Not the soldier, nor the spy, nor the so-called ""sniper."" No, the true messiah of destruction is Pyro—the flame-clad harbinger of judgment, the burning whisper in the night, the nightmare that stalks the battlefield with a muffled giggle.

I do not play Pyro. I become Pyro. Every fiber of my being ignites with the righteous fury of the flamethrower. The weak cry out for mercy. They are met with a cleansing inferno. The so-called ""skilled"" players—those who scoff at Pyro as a mere ""W+M1"" peon—soon learn the truth. There is no escape from the fire. The airblast sends their rockets spiraling back into their foolish faces, their pitiful attempts at aiming shattered by the sheer, unrelenting chaos of close-quarters immolation. The flanking Spy? I hear his footfalls. The retreating Medic? I smell his fear. The Heavy, the Demo, the Scout—all of them burn the same in the end.

TF2 itself is a masterpiece—chaotic, hilarious, and endlessly replayable. But Pyro? Pyro is a philosophy, a manifesto of destruction, a fever dream where fire is the only truth. To those who still doubt, who resist the cleansing embrace of the flames—I say to you: pick up the flamethrower. Don the mask. Forget words, forget hesitation. Speak only in fire.

440,"This is my first public review of literally anything, so here goes. Sometime back in 2012 or 2013, I honestly can't even remember, that's how long ago it was, my classmate recommended this game to me. They showed me the trailers and various shorts that promoted the game that were dubbed in various different languages (up to a certain point, but that's a story for another time). Up to that point, I was into the more casual games like Peggle or Plants vs. Zombies. And seeing what my classmate showed me about this game, as well as seeing some of the art incorporated into the levels in Peggle Extreme, I immediately felt that this is a game that I must play the absolute heck out of! At that moment, the game was already Free to Play, so I thought ""screw it, might as well get it"".

At first, there have been some teething issues, like I had to learn from my classmate how to play certain classes, because the tutorial ended up being staggeringly unhelpful, as in it teaches you the basics of the first-person shooter genre, but not the intricacies of each class., let alone the Four that make up the tutorial to this day. Back then, I thought nothing of it, and just assumed more classes and more detailed tutorials would be added in a future update, this was a consistently updated game at the time, after all. Either way, the classmate showed me around, at least, showed me the important stuff, and answered the questions I would point out along the way.

Since I was too daunted by the sheer amount of servers in the browser, my friend decided it would be best for me to look for a server via Quickplay, and then as if by magic, they'd join the same server as well. Some Quickplay matches later, I'd end up getting used to using some of the server browser features as well, like adding servers to favorites, to come back to them later, or the Friends tab, to join the server my friend is on. We'd end up playing at 2fort the most, since that's where I had the most fun, they'd show me the different funny taunts this game had, including some of the paid taunts, like the Director's Vision, which they generously gifted to me. Then, an update came out that introduced Mann vs. Machine, and I cannot overstate how ecstatic I was playing that, both solo and with that friend. This was literally Plants vs. Zombies for me, but now the plants can move, and upgrade their stats. Since I'd already gotten the hang of the server browser, it would only be a matter of time until I'd stumble upon a server with some unofficial gamemode, or a custom map, so that was my introduction to trade maps. Did I care that people used it to... well, trade with each other on that server? Absolutely not, but rocket jumping across the Minecraft-style map or riding in a minecart was enough for me to have even more of an absolute blast. Don't even get me started about Surf servers! Point being, this game wasn't perfect, but I loved every minute of playing it. 

Years went by, me and my friend both finished school and slowly fell out of touch. I'm still friends with them on Steam, but to be frank, I'm too afraid to bother them now, I think he'd gotten some new friends. But then, so have I, and one of them just so happened to enjoy Team Fortress 2 as well. I remembered that just as I slowly got away from TF2, The Voldemort Devs (if you know, you know) added some sort of new competitive mode for TF2. And I thought, surely it can't get any better, now you can play TF2 in virtually the same way people now play CSGO. Of course, I was oblivious then to the intricacies of matchmaking even in CSGO, as I couldn't be bothered to learn the game. Either way, I boot up TF2 for the first time in a while, and I am absolutely astounded by what I was witnessing. Server browser filled with empty to half-empty servers, no option to Quickplay anymore, just Competitive, which I couldn't afford, Mann vs. Machine, which was also empty half the time, and this new mode called Casual. ""Ooh, Casual,"" I thought, ""That must be what the Quickplay has turned into."" So I completely ignored the warning sign of the empty community servers, and into the dark I lept.

No ability to choose/change team, no ability to spectate, no way to vote for a new map, or to scramble/autobalance. The rounds ended up being a billion times shorter, and you couldn't even extend them without a server reset (barring Capture the Flag, which had the time limit back then and for some reason doesn't now, meaning it can be played indefinitely, so long as both teams agree to not cap. And it's at this point I started to wonder ""Is this really TF2? Is this really the same game that introduced me to the other games by these Devs?"" It sure looks like it, the characters, items and maps are all still there, but... something's missing, something's wrong. And then it dawned on me, right as the game ended and the server reset.

Suddenly, only me and my friends are all that's left from the previous round. The rest either hasn't connected yet, or left the server to be replaced by bots. I was traumatized, I have only seen this kind of swarm of bots on poorly moderated servers back in the day, which were a tiny minority. But now, apparently it's a widespread problem, because as we keep on searching for casual servers, we stumble upon bots time and time again. Surely this can't be what the TF2 community wanted from the competitive matchmaking. Did the TF2 community even want the competitive matchmaking? I vaguely remember the huge hype surrounding it, but I don't remember where it came from, because the TF2 community as I knew it, was not competitive in the slightest. Sure there was some hostility towards Free-to-Players, but nothing over the top rival. Then I rewatched the videos from when competitive was introduced, and I, for the life of me, couldn't put a finger on who the people advocating for competitive TF2 even were. And advocate they did, there were whole interviews from these people with the Devs.

So that begs the questions. How did the Devs royally mess this up? How did they let some random group of unknown people that seem to have this tiny cult of personality built around them completely mangle the game beyond all recognition, to the point that it's so broken, that even the very group of people responsible for it, left for a different game?!

Of course, the bot issues have been fixed... for now, but I won't invest any more a dime into this game, than I did simply to talk in this game! It used to be free! It didn't deter bots from spamming slurs in chat, it only hurt innocent players! This game doesn't deserve the money! Do not repeat my mistake, stay muted in casual chat! In fact, only download TF2 to play mods of it, there will be no shortage of them, and all of them will allow for free chatting, free choice of server selection, and the tagline of ""The most fun you can have online"" should be given to TF2 mods instead. Invest into those, not the main game! Not until we see work being done by the actual Devs, not some contractor and their plant pot! And if they refuse, it will only be a cautionary tale for the fans of other multiplayer games from these Devs.",False,True,"first public review literally anything , goes .

440,"Team Fortress 2, in my honest opinion, is one of the best games I have ever played. Even though the game was created more than a decade ago, the game still hasn't lost its hype, shown through the inclusive and wholesome community that hasn't lost its spark for all this time, arranging community events, items, and even petitions like #fixtf2. 
Not just that, but the gameplay is really immersive and unique. There are several modes in the game that you can engage in, the main gamemodes subdividing into 'Casual, Competitive, MVM, Custom, etc.' (Think it was called Custom? I really don't remember... might be called 'Online'). Casual features many different gamemodes like King of the Hill, Capture the Flag (my honest favorite gamemode), and more! Competitive is just what it sounds like: PROBABLY exactly the same as Casual but a lot sweatier (I haven't done a single Competitive round throughout my 300 hours lol). MVM is honestly my favorite gamemode. Even though it costs ~1. something USD, and its required to have more than one ticket to finish your, uh, 'quest' (forgot what its called), you get a ton of rewards everytime you beat the waves. You even have a chance of getting your own Australium weapon, basically a golden version of it. Even if you don't, you get a Killstreak...uh...something. Trust me, it looks cool when you apply it
Also, the different mercenaries (the characters) have really unique personalities/gameplay/dialouge/etc. For example, we have Soldier here, who is a proud American and loves to cover his vision with his hat, or Sniper here, with a thing for bottled Jarate (search it up), and maybe Spy here, a french
Each mercenary has unique weapons and stats, overall making the game much more fun and interesting, each character providing a different POV and gamestyle. Not just that, but there are 'subclasses' that aren't official, but classes you can use, such as the Hoovy (basically Heavy Weaponsguy the tank, except you slap sandwiches onto enemies) or the Demoknight (honestly one of my favorite subclasses, its when you give a drunk Scottish guy more scrumpy and a huge axe.
There are even special events once in a while, such as the Scream Fortress event (Halloween) where you have the chance to battle a monkey who oddly resembles Sniper, and Demoman's eye (you heard that right).
Forgot to mention this, but you get a wide range of weapons and cosmetics to select from. Each mercenary has many different weapons that are unique in their own ways, each effectively changing your gameplay. Cosmetics, well, self-explanatory.
Lastly (probably one of the best features in the game,) once in a while you can item drops that give you free weapons. No, you don't have to buy them seperately like DLCs, it just gives you a weapon once in a while. Is it a useful feature to most of the community? No. Do I think its just cool? Yes.
Overall, the game gets a 9/10. The only problem I can think of is because of the bots. That is all.
If you actually read the whole thing, I really appreciate it.",True,True,"Team Fortress 2 , honest opinion , one best games ever played .

440,"TF2 A game that deserves more

TF2 or Team Fortress 2 is a game made by Valve that to this day of it’s 18 year life span has not received any major updates in a little over seven years. The last major update was the Jungle inferno update which brought maps, taunts, the jungle inferno campaign, new weapons for pyro and a bunch of balancing for all of the mercenaries, but ever since that it has been mostly quiet from Valve with the exclusion of some small updates here and there. The community has contributed their fair share with their own taunts and concepts being added during the holidays. From my information there are two devs working currently on the game (This may be false) realising small bug fixes every once in a while and yet TF2’s community flourishes having 50k players every single day and even reaching all-time player peaks during for example the summer of 2023. And yet Valve still ignores the game and its community.

Now here is where I make my point, TF2 and its community deserves better, better then how Valve’s treating it at least, TF2 deserves more. The only reason this will be a positive review is because first: i like the game, and second: I have heard from various sources that Valve are starting to notice that they still have people playing with their old toy. Also there are alot of thinks i would like to go in to about TF2 but in those seven years of no updates someone must have wrote something more comprehensive then whatever I would put out.

(My opinion will maybe change the review depending on how it all turns out).

This game is overwhelmingly chaotic and lacks a coherent structure, making it feel boring and trivial. With no story to engage players and a difficulty level that leans towards hard, it may frustrate those looking for a meaningful experience. The graphics are merely normal, and the music is forgettable, contributing to an overall sense of disinterest. While it might be free, I find it hard to recommend this game as it offers little more than confusion and a lack of replayability.

570,"Dota 2 - A Masterpiece of Depth and Strategy

⭐ Rating: 10/10

Dota 2 is not just a game—it's an experience, a battleground of wit, skill, and teamwork that has defined the MOBA genre for over a decade. With over 120 heroes, each offering unique abilities and playstyles, no two matches are ever the same. The strategic depth is unmatched, requiring players to master mechanics, item builds, map awareness, and team coordination.

Pros:
✅ Infinite Replayability – No match ever plays out the same, ensuring endless fun and learning.
✅ Completely Free-to-Play – Every hero is available from the start, with no pay-to-win mechanics.
✅ High Skill Ceiling – Always room to improve, whether it's micro, macro, or decision-making.
✅ Thriving Esports Scene – The International and other tournaments keep the competitive spirit alive.
✅ Deep Strategy – Team composition, warding, counter-picking, and map control make every game a chess match.

Cons:
❌ Steep Learning Curve – The game can feel overwhelming for newcomers.
❌ Toxic Community – Like any competitive game, some players take things too seriously.
❌ Time-Consuming – Matches can last 30-60 minutes, making it hard for casual play.

Despite the challenges, Dota 2 is the ultimate test of skill and strategy. It’s brutally unforgiving but equally rewarding when mastered. If you’re looking for a game that will challenge you and provide endless depth, there’s no better choice.

Verdict:
Dota 2 is not for the faint of heart, but for those willing to invest time, it’s one of the most rewarding multiplayer experiences ever made.

Would I recommend it? Absolutely. But only if you're ready for a journey filled with both frustration and triumph.

For newcomers, the experience can be particularly daunting; the game is notorious for its steep learning curve and can feel unwelcoming at first.

Indeed, ""Dota 2"" is not particularly new-player friendly. The wealth of information and mechanics can be overwhelming for those just starting out. In addition, the competitive nature of the community often means that solo players encounter teammates who may have a much higher level of experience, sometimes leading to criticism and hostility. This environment can be disheartening for beginners trying to find their footing.

To successfully navigate the initial challenges of ""Dota 2,"" I recommend focusing on a select group of five heroes that resonate with your play style. Pick these heroes and commit to mastering them, as familiarity will significantly enhance your understanding of the game. Watching educational content, such as gameplay videos or tutorials, can also be invaluable, particularly given that the in-game tutorial primarily prepares players for bot matches rather than PvP scenarios.

Overall, while ""Dota 2"" may present hurdles for new players, those who persevere and take the time to learn will ultimately discover a richly rewarding experience defined by strategy, teamwork, and a constantly evolving meta. The key lies in finding your niche within the game and continuously refining your skills, all while seeking support and guidance from the wealth of resources available online.",True,True,"`` Dota 2 '' game often elicits complex array emotions players .

570,"Every online community has it's toxic trolls. Dota 2, unfortunately has become one of THE most toxic where the matching system pairs you with these kinds of individuals. The overwatch system which reviews behaviour will then punish you when you are taunted by trolls, and will protect trolls that do the taunting. This is just the tip of the iceberg, do yourself a favour and turn around. If you do decide to stay, by no means give them your money. The Dota+ subscription which is supposed to help pair you with other players at your level does not actually work. The coaches that are supposed to help you in game are rarely available. There are no actual in game tips or cues available to make the subscription worth. The analytics they offer for the subscription are worthless because you can play your best and still have 3-4 players on your team that will throw the game. In game purchases are overpriced. The list goes on, so if you do stay, save your pennies, and try not to become another toxic troll.

570,"Dota 2 is a fantastic game mechanically and has a high skill ceiling and learning curve, but the constant re-balancing and complete lack of a mode that will teach you how to actually be good at the game leaves it as an utter mess. As with all games of this style the community can be both the best and worst part of this game, but if you're trying to learn the game in matches with strangers be prepared to be yelled at to play bot games to get better, then completely crush the bots on the highest difficulty because they're incompetent compared to the players at even the lowest rank. The only people who are likely to enjoy this game are people who have either played thousands of hours of MOBAs already, or people who's goal isn't actually to play the game but instead want to trash talk in chat. This game has a huge problem with not only bots but also smurfs, and each match is almost guaranteed to be completely one sided, whether it's for or against you, except for at the highest levels of play. If you love MOBAs and don't care how many slurs they call you in chat, then this game may be the best you've ever played, but for the average player I could never recommend it.

You might be wondering ""That doesn't sound like a thumbs up, then?"" 

Dota is a very good game. This game rewards you for learning it and paying attention to details like nothing else. The heroes are all very unique and serve unique purposes in the macro game. If you understand your build choices and are able to adapt on the fly, you can change the game itself for every other participant. Have that with 10 heroes in a match and you are always coming across some new situation, some new challenge on every game you play. And when you can rise up to that challenge and win with the help of your teamamates, that feeling can be like the most potent drug injected directly into your veins.

The thing is, most of the things that suck about dota come from the people playing it rather than the game itself. With how much influence a single player has, they can ruin the game for everyone just as much as they can make it a unforgettable experience.

The games are hardly ever balanced because there is always 1 or 2 people that feed the enemy team kills because they are bad at the game, so one enemy player becomes very strong and just owns your team all game, not fun.

570,"Dota 2 – A Deep, Punishing, and Highly Competitive MOBA
Hours Played: 22.6

Dota 2 is a high-skill, strategy-heavy MOBA that rewards game knowledge, teamwork, and mechanical skill. It’s brutal for newcomers, but for those who stick with it, the depth and strategic possibilities are nearly endless.

The Good
✅ Incredibly Deep Gameplay – Over 120 heroes, thousands of item builds, and infinite strategies.

✅ Completely Free-to-Play – No pay-to-win mechanics—only cosmetics.

✅ High Skill Ceiling – Mastering a single hero can take dozens of hours, but that’s part of the fun.

✅ Epic Comeback Potential – One good team fight can turn the tide of a match.

✅ Regular Updates & Esports Scene – Huge balance patches keep the game fresh, and pro matches are amazing to watch.

The Bad
❌ Steep Learning Curve – Mechanics, items, and hero matchups take time to learn.

❌ Toxicity in Matches – Expect blame, flaming, and rage if things go south.

❌ Long Matches – Games can last 40-60 minutes, and bad matches feel like a slog.

Final Verdict
With 22+ hours, I can say Dota 2 is one of the deepest and most rewarding MOBAs, but it’s not beginner-friendly. If you’re willing to learn and embrace the challenge, it’s one of the best strategy games out there.

Dota 2 Review
Introduction
Dota 2, created by Valve, is one of the most popular and competitive multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) titles. Released in 2013, the game features intense team-based strategy, a large number of heroes, and a vibrant player community. Dota 2's deep gameplay mechanics make it a challenging but rewarding experience for both casual and professional players. In this review, we'll look at the gameplay, graphics, sound design, and performance to see what makes it unique in the gaming world.
However, in reality, the developers do not give the players the attention they deserve. Many issues are to blame, including the lack of a way to announce the game's development plan that can be followed, slow game patch updates, and etc.

Gameplay & mechanics
Dota 2 provides a deep and strategic experience in which two teams of five players compete to destroy the opposing Ancient while defending their own. The game includes over 120 distinct heroes, each with their own abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. The mechanics include last-hitting creeps, skilled item use, positioning, teamwork, and advanced tactics such as juking in the fog of war, Low-High Ground, Outplayed + Counterplay, and so on.
The high skill ceiling makes Dota 2 one of the most difficult MOBAs, but it also keeps players interested.  While beginners may struggle with the game's complexity, it does provide tutorials, coaching tools, and AI practice modes to help them improve.  The dynamic gameplay ensures that no two matches are alike, making each one an exciting test of skill and strategy.
 In fact, for new players, this game is very difficult to learn quickly due to the many mechanics of the game, which require a lot of effort, both playing alone and watching the competition.

Graphics and Art Style
 Dota 2 boasts a fantasy-inspired art style that combines detailed hero models, immersive environments, and fluid animation.  Valve has consistently improved the visuals over time, making the game more polished and appealing.

 Each hero has a distinct design that makes them easily identifiable on the battlefield.  The game's day-night cycle, spell effects, and animations enhance its visual appeal, while a variety of cosmetic skins and arcana items allow for customization.  Despite these additions, the game retains its balanced competitive nature, as skins are purely aesthetic.

 The early and later versions' character models differ significantly.  There is a significant positive difference.

Sound and Music
 Dota 2 has excellent sound design, which adds to the game's immersive experience.  Each hero has a distinct voice line, which adds personality and depth to the lore.  The in-game music changes dynamically depending on the flow of the battle, heightening the tension and excitement of matches.

 Sound effects such as ability casts, attacks, and item activations are clear and impactful, providing useful audio cues that allow players to react more quickly.  Furthermore, announcer packs and kill-streak sounds add another layer of customization, allowing players to tailor their experience.

 The in-game sound pack (background sound pack) has numerous records.  I recommend the song for the International 10 event.  It has a beautiful melody.

Performance and Technical Aspects
 Dota 2 runs on the Source 2 engine, which provides smooth performance and excellent optimization across a wide range of hardware configurations.  The game runs well on both low- and high-end PCs, making it accessible to a large number of players.

 Conclusion
 Dota 2 is still one of the best and most challenging MOBAs available.  Its deep strategic gameplay, stunning visuals, immersive sound design, and strong performance set it apart in the esports scene.  Although the game's steep learning curve may intimidate newcomers, those who put in the time to master it will find it endlessly rewarding.
 Personally, this is the best game I've ever played.

570,"Dear Valve,

As a dedicated Meepo player, I would like to express my concerns regarding the recent changes made to Meepo in the latest updates. Meepo is a unique and highly challenging hero in Dota 2, requiring significant skill and practice to master. However, the recent updates have overlooked his core characteristics and introduced changes that feel misguided. Below are my detailed concerns and suggestions for improvement:

Key Concerns
1、Neutral Items in the First 4 Levels:
Meepo’s innate ability is tied to neutral item selection, yet there are no suitable neutral items for him in the first 4 levels. Adding more options without addressing this issue renders the mechanic meaningless.
2、New Shard Design:
The current Shard design lacks the essence of Meepo and offers underwhelming numerical values. In a meta dominated by AOE abilities, these values are negligible and fail to enhance Meepo’s gameplay.
3、Removal of ""Ransack"" Shard:
Deleting the ""Ransack"" Shard was a poor decision. This Shard allowed Meepo to have flexible itemization options, moving away from a rigid stat-building path. It was a well-designed feature that should be reinstated.

4、Level 25 Talents:
Both Level 25 talents are underwhelming. Reducing cast time by 1 second and increasing health by 350 are insignificant at this stage of the game. These talents appear to be hastily added without proper consideration.

5、Community Feedback:
I have gathered feedback from numerous Meepo enthusiasts, and all agree that the ""Ransack"" Shard should be brought back.

Suggestions for Improvement

1、Neutral Items:
Add enchantments to neutral items that provide attributes (Strength, Agility, Intelligence, or All Attributes) to better suit Meepo’s needs.

2、Shard Design:
Reintroduce the ""Ransack"" Shard and replace the ""More Meepos"" Shard, as the latter does not align with Meepo’s playstyle.

3、Level 25 Talents:
Replace ""Reduced Cast Time by 1 Second"" with ""Additional Clone.""
Change ""+350 Health"" to ""Poof Damage Becomes Pure"" or ""Attacks Apply Movement Slow (similar to the old passive slow)"" with a value of 12% per Meepo, stacking.

Conclusion
Meepo is a hero that many of us deeply love and enjoy playing. However, it seems that the recent updates lack a solid understanding of his design and potential. I sincerely hope you will consider these suggestions to improve the hero and make him more enjoyable for dedicated players.

Thank you for your attention.

570,"Dota is the best MOBA on the market, in my opinion. The visual identity holds true to modern expectations even to this day, after so many years while the the game play is unique and fun and with skilled mechanics to master at the forefront of it all. Truly outstanding.

The bad part is that the game is filled with smurfs, while Valve themselves declared it illegal to smurf and banning smurfs from time to time, only for the smurfs to buy new accounts and go at it again like nothing really happened. This is mind boggling as surely a company such as Valve with access to information such as you email address, PC, IP, MAC address, PC component ID's and many more behavioral and game play patterns, could know if the same person who uses account A is also using account B to smurf. I'm guessing they either don't have proper detection mechanisms in place, or they just declare war on smurfs only to let them freely play the game.
Anyhow, if you are in for a battle of nervs, go ahead and download DOTA 2. I'm sure you will have fun and also get pissed off (or on, pun intended) by the smurfs.

570,"I want to recommend DOTA 2, I really do. HOWEVER...

I was a Warcraft 3 player back in the day. I spent most of my time playing custom maps. Like sheep tag, EVOLVES, LOAP, TD, etc... It was the first time in my gaming career that I sat down to play before bedtime and was surprised at the sun rising in the early morning. The Defense of the Ancients All-Stars map was a game that mildly interested me, but I ended up becoming annoyed when the custom map server browser became inundated with DOTA lobbies and destroyed part of the vibrant ecosystem of new and creative maps the community was building.

This continues on even today. DOTA 2 has a custom map function as well, but most of the commonly played maps seem to be DOTA variations and the recreations of excellent Warcraft 3 custom maps go primarily unplayed. Personally I consider this problematic. We used to be a community of gamers who played a variety of games and enjoyed exploring the possibilities, now we have people who only play particular live service games and never expand their horizons with new experiences.

Overall Rating: ★★★★☆

Dota 2, developed by Valve, is one of the most complex and rewarding multiplayer games ever created. As a free-to-play MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena), it offers deep strategy, intense competition, and nearly endless replayability. With over 120 heroes, constant updates, and a thriving esports scene, Dota 2 remains a top-tier competitive game.

Gameplay & Depth: ★★★★★

At its core, Dota 2 is all about strategy, teamwork, and mechanical skill. Matches typically last 30–60 minutes, requiring precise execution and decision-making. Every hero has unique abilities, and item builds can drastically change their playstyle. No two games feel the same, making it one of the deepest competitive experiences in gaming.

Balance & Updates: ★★★★☆

Valve frequently updates the game with hero reworks, new items, and balance changes. While the meta constantly shifts, some updates introduce overpowered heroes, leading to balance issues. However, Valve’s commitment to refining the game keeps it fresh and competitive.

Matchmaking & Community: ★★★☆☆

Matchmaking can be hit-or-miss, especially in ranked play. Toxicity is a common issue, as Dota 2 has a notoriously tough community. New players often struggle due to the game’s steep learning curve, though tools like the in-game coaching system help ease the process.

Graphics & Performance: ★★★★☆

Visually, Dota 2 is polished, with detailed hero models and vibrant environments. The Source 2 engine ensures smooth performance, even on lower-end PCs. Occasional server issues and lag spikes can be frustrating, but they don’t significantly impact the experience.

Esports & Competitive Scene: ★★★★★

The Dota 2 esports scene is one of the biggest in gaming, with The International offering record-breaking prize pools. Watching pro matches is an exciting experience, and the in-game spectator tools make it easy for players to follow high-level play.

Overall Verdict:

Dota 2 is a masterpiece of competitive gaming, offering unmatched strategic depth and thrilling team-based battles.

570,"Dota 2 is like trying to solve a Rubik’s Cube while riding a rollercoaster—blindfolded. It’s a game where you’ll spend 40 minutes strategizing, coordinating, and outplaying your opponents, only to lose because someone accidentally clicked the wrong item or fed the enemy carry *one too many times*. The learning curve isn’t just steep; it’s a vertical cliff with no ropes, and the tutorial is basically the community yelling “git gud” at you. But hey, once you get the hang of it, there’s nothing more satisfying than landing a perfect Black Hole or pulling off a game-winning play. Just don’t get too attached to your MMR—it’s a fickle beast that giveth and taketh away with no mercy. Dota 2 is a masterpiece of chaos, salt, and occasional brilliance, where every match feels like a soap opera with way too many plot twists. Whether you’re a casual player or a tryhard, one thing’s for sure: you’ll either love it or swear it off forever (until you queue up again tomorrow).",True,True,"Dota 2 like trying solve Rubik ’ Cube riding rollercoaster—blindfolded . ’ game ’ spend 40 minutes strategizing , coordinating , outplaying opponents , lose someone accidentally clicked wrong item fed enemy carry * one many times * . learning curve ’ steep ; ’ vertical cliff ropes , tutorial basically community yelling “ git gud ” . hey , get hang , ’ nothing satisfying landing perfect Black Hole pulling game-winning play . ’ get attached MMR—it ’ fickle beast giveth taketh away mercy .

570,"Alright, let's dive into the chaotic world of Dota 2, where dreams are made, and friendships are broken faster than you can say ""GG.""

Gameplay: Ah, Dota 2, the game that takes ""easy to learn, hard to master"" and cranks it up to ""impossible to learn, soul-crushing to master."" The gameplay is a dizzying ballet of strategy, reflexes, and sheer dumb luck. With over 100 heroes to choose from, each with their own unique abilities, you'll spend more time figuring out who does what than actually playing the game. And let's not forget the joy of being flamed by your teammates for not knowing the intricate mechanics of denying creeps or stacking camps. But hey, when you finally pull off that perfect combo and wipe the enemy team, it's like hitting the jackpot in a casino—pure, unadulterated euphoria.

Design: Valve's artists deserve a standing ovation for making a game that's both visually stunning and utterly incomprehensible. The crisp, readable style ensures that you can almost tell what's happening in those chaotic 5v5 brawls. Almost. The map is a work of art, with its lush jungles, treacherous rivers, and strategically placed towers that will shred you to pieces if you so much as look at them funny. And let's not forget the heroes themselves, each one a beautifully designed bundle of nightmares and frustration.

Critique: Now, let's get to the fun part—tearing it apart. Dota 2's learning curve isn't just steep; it's a vertical cliff face covered in grease. New players are thrown into the deep end with a cinder block tied to their ankles, left to flounder and drown in a sea of mechanics and jargon. The community, bless their hearts, is about as welcoming as a nest of vipers. Expect to be told you suck more times than you can count. And the matchmaking system? It's like a sadistic game of Russian roulette, where you're just as likely to be paired with a team of pros as you are with a bunch of headless chickens.

In conclusion, Dota 2 is a beautifully crafted, endlessly frustrating masterpiece. It's a game that will test your patience, your sanity, and your ability to withstand verbal abuse from strangers on the internet. But for those who persevere, it's a rewarding experience like no other. Just remember to take breaks, breathe, and maybe keep a stress ball handy. You'll need it.",True,True,"Alright , let 's dive chaotic world Dota 2 , dreams made , friendships broken faster say `` GG .

Patches are often unbalanced and devs will let heros stay strong for a very long time. They play favorites with heros(Tiny,spec , etc) where they will be meta in every single patch for actual years with out solving the issue or nerfing them in any meaningful way.  Between Dev Bias and throwing half thought out  patches onto the players and making the player base test the patches is extremely lazy from a dev standpoint.  

Plus the player base is just toxic the devs do very little to fix it they have always had a hands off approach and it shows. You can have literal 30-40 year olds have a mental break down because you decide to play a hero they don't like. It's quite insane to see the mental sink this game really is.

570,"Dota 2 has a special place in my gaming heart, and it's not just because it’s one of the most popular MOBAs (Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas) in the world, but because it offers an experience like no other. Here are some of the reasons why I’m so drawn to the game:

1. Deep and Strategic Gameplay

What sets Dota 2 apart from other games is its incredible depth. Every match feels unique, and there are always new strategies to explore. With over 100 heroes, each with its own set of abilities, learning how to utilize each hero to its maximum potential keeps things fresh. Whether I’m playing support, carry, or in the offlane, the strategic choices feel vast and rewarding.

2. Constantly Evolving Meta

One of the reasons Dota 2 never feels stale is the ever-evolving meta. Valve regularly releases patches, changing hero strengths, item builds, and more. This constant balance ensures that no one strategy stays dominant for too long, and it keeps the game feeling new and exciting. I love that I’m never truly ""done"" learning.

3. The Thrill of Team Play

Dota 2 is not a solo experience; it’s a game built around teamwork and cooperation. The synergy between heroes and the way you can win or lose based on team coordination is a huge part of the appeal. The excitement of executing a perfect team fight, or the tension of defending your base in the late game, keeps my adrenaline pumping. It feels like a shared journey with friends (or sometimes even strangers) towards victory.

4. High Skill Ceiling

One of the things that keeps me coming back to Dota 2 is its high skill ceiling. The game has a lot of room for growth, and you can always improve. Whether it’s learning more advanced mechanics like creep stacking or improving your map awareness, the feeling of personal improvement over time is so satisfying. The sense of accomplishment when I pull off a difficult play, like a game-changing Roshan steal or a perfect initiation, is unmatched.

5. Epic Matches and Tournaments

The intensity of Dota 2 matches, especially in the late game, is something that can't be found in many other games. The back-and-forth, nail-biting action as teams try to push for the final win is always captivating. Plus, Dota 2’s competitive scene is massive, with The International (TI) being one of the most exciting and prestigious tournaments in all of esports. Watching professional players execute high-level strategies and mechanics makes me appreciate the game even more.

6. The Community and Customization

While Dota 2’s community can be challenging at times, it’s also filled with passionate players who really love the game. I’ve found that playing with like-minded people who are all in for the strategy and excitement makes the experience all the more rewarding. Plus, the game’s customization options—whether through skins, announcer packs, or loading screens—let me personalize my experience and make it my own.

7. Free-to-Play Accessibility

Another reason I love Dota 2 is its free-to-play model. Unlike other competitive games, I don’t need to pay for new heroes or content. Everyone starts on equal footing, which creates a truly fair playing field for both new players and veterans alike.

Dota 2 has so much to offer, and its complexity, strategic depth, and sheer excitement keep me coming back for more. It’s a game where no two matches are the same, and every win or loss feels earned. If you love competitive gaming with deep mechanics, there’s no other experience quite like it.

570,"Dota is gone… Solo ranked is complete trash, just a river of crying. 90% of the communication is people whining that something isn't going their way or that someone made a mistake. You can be skilled, play a ton of heroes well, but there will always be some garbage player who, instead of defending the Ancient (DEFENSE OF THE ANCIENT!!!) in the 50th minute, after feeding the enemy team, decides to grief in the jungle even when the game is still winnable.
And then this clown, on top of throwing the game, hands out reports to teammates and wishes cancer upon their families because he played like an absolute loser. These reports land you in a cesspool of players where azbuka dominates, accompanied by gameplay with the IQ of a donkey. These players are literally the cancer of this game, like a Venomancer mid going 0-8 in 10 minutes, so only about 1 in 10 games is actually playable.
These useless trash players have only one skill: spamming reports. The only way out of this hellhole is to find a group of people to boost your communication score. But if you're addicted to playing, you just suffer through these games with losers, constantly getting reported, sometimes for the dumbest reasons. Like playing support, going to pull a camp, and then Олег(Oleg), useless azbuka dog, the Pos1 Anti-Mage, dies like a noob (ending with a final score of 0-11, obviously) and then spends the rest of the game spamming azbuka in chat instead of playing.
There are games that are worth it, but is the suffering really worth it? After so many years in Dota, quitting is just not an option anymore.

570,"Dota 2, developed by Valve, is one of the most competitive and complex multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games in the world. With deep strategic gameplay, a massive hero pool, and a thriving esports scene, Dota 2 offers an unparalleled experience for players who love intense, skill-based battles.

Positive Aspects:
✅ Deep and Strategic Gameplay – With over 120 heroes, countless item builds, and ever-evolving strategies, every match feels unique and rewarding for players who master the game.

✅ Completely Free-to-Play – Unlike many other games, Dota 2 gives players access to all heroes from the start, making it fair and balanced without pay-to-win mechanics.

✅ Thriving Esports Scene – With The International offering some of the biggest prize pools in esports history, Dota 2 remains one of the most exciting games to watch and play competitively.

✅ Constant Updates and Balancing – Valve regularly updates the game with new heroes, balance changes, and seasonal events, keeping the meta fresh and engaging.

✅ Incredible Depth and Replayability – No two matches are ever the same due to the complexity of hero interactions, team compositions, and in-game decisions.

Negative Aspects:
❌ Steep Learning Curve – Dota 2 is notoriously difficult for beginners, requiring hundreds of hours to truly understand its mechanics, making it intimidating for new players.

❌ Toxic Community – Like many competitive online games, Dota 2 has a reputation for toxicity, especially in ranked matches where communication can be aggressive.

❌ Matches Can Be Long and Frustrating – Games often last between 30-60 minutes, and a single mistake can cost the match, making losses especially frustrating.

Final Verdict:
Dota 2 is a masterpiece for strategy and competitive gaming fans, offering unmatched depth and an ever-evolving experience. However, its steep learning curve and intense matches might not be for everyone.

730,"Counter-Strike 2 is the long-awaited upgrade to one of the most iconic FPS games in history. Built on the Source 2 engine, it brings improved graphics, enhanced responsiveness, and a reworked smoke grenade system that adds more tactical depth. But does it truly feel like a step forward?

Pros:
✅ Visual & Performance Upgrade: The move to Source 2 provides crisper visuals, better lighting, and improved physics, making the game feel more modern while retaining its classic style.
✅ Responsive Gameplay: CS2 maintains the tight, skill-based mechanics that make Counter-Strike a masterpiece in competitive shooters.
✅ New Smoke Mechanics: Dynamic smoke grenades that interact with bullets and explosions add fresh strategic possibilities.
✅ Free Upgrade for CS:GO Players: If you owned CS:GO, you get CS2 for free—so there's no risk in trying it out.

Cons:
❌ Missing Features: Some beloved features from CS:GO (like certain maps, modes, and community servers) are still absent.
❌ Hit Reg & Subtick System Issues: While the new subtick update system aims to improve responsiveness, some players have reported inconsistencies in hit registration.
❌❌ Balancing & Anti-Cheat: Cheating remains an issue, and certain weapon balances could still use fine-tuning.
❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌
FINAL !!!! 
Counter-Strike 2 is a solid evolution rather than a revolution. It brings necessary updates to a legendary game but still feels like a work in progress. If you're a long-time fan, it's worth playing, but if you're expecting a groundbreaking experience, you might be slightly disappointed. That said, with continued updates and community feedback, CS2 has the potential to become just as beloved as its predecessor.

Ah, Counter-Strike 2. The long-awaited, heavily hyped, Source 2-powered evolution of the greatest tactical shooter of all time. And what did we get? A broken mess that makes you appreciate Counter-Strike: Global Offensive—a game we all spent years complaining about.

First, let's talk about the servers. You ever wanted to experience what it’s like to time travel? Well, now you can! Thanks to CS2’s incredible sub-tick system, every gunfight feels like you're guessing where the past version of your opponent might be, while the future version of yourself is already dead. Laggy peeks, input delay, and rubberbanding galore—it’s like Valve found the worst possible way to implement online gameplay and ran with it.

Then, we have the cheaters. Oh boy. If you ever dreamed of playing against professional aimlock enthusiasts in every second game, CS2 has you covered. The VAC system? Think of it as a museum piece—nice to look at but completely useless. Mass reporting doesn’t work, the cheaters never get banned, and somehow, they always win. It's almost impressive.

But don’t worry, CS2 did bring improvements! They gave us volumetric smokes—because that’s what everyone wanted, right? Not better matchmaking, not reliable hit registration, but dynamic, 3D smokes that look cool while you get shot through them by someone using wallhacks.

Meanwhile, Valorant exists, a game that actually runs well, has anti-cheat that does something, and doesn’t make you question if your bullets are real or just imaginary suggestions to the game engine.

Either from yourself of from your party bros, you decide to hop on again, thinking about a nice juicy win streak, some nice nades, some heavenly headshots and frags.

🚨 Cheating Epidemic

The anti-cheat system (VAC) is completely broken. Every other game is infested with blatant cheaters — wallhacks, aimlocks, you name it. Mass reporting does nothing, and it’s painfully obvious that the system is either not working or not being monitored properly. Meanwhile, competitors like Valorant have managed to create far more effective anti-cheat systems — so why hasn’t Valve? If a free-to-play game is going to survive, anti-cheat HAS to be a priority.

🌍 Toxic Environment and Trolls

The community is more toxic than ever. Every match seems to have at least one griefer or troll ruining the experience for everyone else — and yet, no meaningful moderation exists. The vote kick system is abused constantly, and players using racial slurs or griefing matches face no real consequences. There’s no accountability, no consequences — and it shows.

🎯 Broken Matchmaking and Hit Registration

The sub-tick system has made the gameplay feel inconsistent and unreliable. You can shoot first and still die. Peeking feels like a gamble, and hit registration is frustratingly inconsistent. High ping abusers and regional matchmaking issues only make things worse.

💀 Valve — Fix Your Game

Counter-Strike is too important to the FPS world to be left in this state. The player base deserves a working anti-cheat, better matchmaking, and actual consequences for toxicity and cheating. Valve needs to take these issues seriously — otherwise, players will continue migrating to other games that actually care about the competitive experience.

Verdict: Counter-Strike 2 has the potential to be the best FPS in the world — but only if Valve decides to stop treating it like a cash cow and starts investing in fixing the core issues. Until then, it’s hard to recommend this game to anyone serious about competitive play",False,True,"🚨 Cheating Epidemic anti-cheat system ( VAC ) completely broken .

730,"Performance and Optimization Nightmare ""our cs2 experience""
When Counter-Strike 2 was first teased, there were high hopes. The game was supposed to be more ""next-gen,"" with improved graphics, smoother gameplay, and advanced technology that should’ve pushed the franchise into the future. Unfortunately, what we got instead feels like a rushed, undercooked product. Even with a top-tier gaming PC—one that comfortably runs CS:GO at high frame rates—I’m seeing Counter-Strike 2 stutter and lag. It’s as if the game is trying to push something it’s not ready for. FPS drops occur regularly, and the frame rates plummet during high-intensity moments, something that simply wasn’t an issue in its predecessor. The optimization is absolutely terrible.

To make matters worse, there’s an issue with how the game allocates resources. I’ve seen instances where my GPU usage is well below 60%, and my CPU spikes, all while the game stutters to keep up. The result? A frustrating, broken experience where you’re constantly fighting against the game's inherent performance flaws. That might be something you can tolerate in an early beta, but this is the full release, and it's completely inexcusable. It doesn’t matter if you’ve got an RTX 3090 or the latest Intel chip, the game will make you feel like you’re playing on an ancient machine.

Inconsistent Hit Registration and Broken Mechanics
Counter-Strike has always been about precision and skill. A large part of its charm comes from that skill-based combat, where landing shots is directly tied to your aim and timing. But with Counter-Strike 2, the game has broken that core principle.

The so-called “sub-tick” system is a mess. For those who aren’t familiar, this was introduced as a way to improve server tick rates and reduce lag-related issues. Instead of improving things, it has made hit registration feel wildly inconsistent. I’ll be facing an enemy at close range, unload an entire magazine, only to see my shots whiff completely. There’s a delay between the time I pull the trigger and when the shots actually register, and this isn’t just occasional—it’s constant.

You’ll find yourself dying around corners where you’re certain you had the angle, or getting one-tapped by enemies whose bullets seem to bend through walls. It’s not just frustrating, it’s completely maddening. The fundamental mechanics that once made the series great are in shambles. What’s the point of precision aiming when the game itself can’t get the basics right?

Cheating Epidemic: A Competitive Nightmare
One of the most frustrating things about Counter-Strike 2 is the fact that Valve has somehow failed to address the cheating problem in any meaningful way. Aimbots, wallhacks, speed hacks, you name it—cheaters are running rampant in this game, and there’s no real effort to stem the tide.

I’ve spent more time in matches recently reporting players than actually enjoying the game. And even when you do report someone, there’s no guarantee anything will be done about it. Valve’s anti-cheat system feels like a joke, especially when you encounter blatant cheaters who have no fear of being caught. It’s ruining the game’s competitive integrity. What’s the point of trying to be good at a game when your opponents can essentially toggle on god-mode cheats and you’re left helpless?

It’s so bad that I’ve been in matches where cheaters completely dominate, and no one can do anything about it. It destroys the fun of playing competitively. It’s all the more upsetting because Counter-Strike used to be a title where competitive fairness was sacred. Now, it feels like a free-for-all, where cheating is normalized and punished rarely—if at all.

Content Removal: The Soul of Counter-Strike is Gone
One of the biggest slaps in the face to longtime fans is the removal of classic content and game modes. Gone are the beloved modes like Arms Race and Danger Zone, which added variety and fun to the game when you wanted a break from competitive matches. These modes helped flesh out CS:GO, offering something different when the typical 5v5 match just didn’t cut it. Now, with Counter-Strike 2, those modes are mysteriously absent, leaving a void that no amount of new skins or maps can fill.

On top of that, the removal of support for macOS was a baffling decision. Many players in the community, including myself, used to play on Macs, and this sudden exclusion has left a large portion of the fanbase unable to even play the game. For a game that has prided itself on being accessible, this is a huge step back.

Lack of Communication and Developer Inaction
Valve's silence is deafening. The community has voiced its concerns repeatedly, yet the developers have remained almost entirely mute. No clear updates, no explanations for why the game is in the state it’s in—just radio silence. Players are being left in the dark, wondering whether Valve even cares about fixing the game or if they’re just going to move on to the next big title.

This lack of communication has only fueled the anger within the community. We’ve seen them take months to address even the most basic issues, and the fear that Counter-Strike 2 will continue to be neglected is growing every day. The franchise has always had a strong relationship with its fanbase, but that’s rapidly eroding as Valve continues to push out half-baked updates and ignores player feedback.

The State of the Community
Perhaps one of the most disheartening aspects of Counter-Strike 2 is the state of its community. The game has become a toxic wasteland, with constant cheating, connection issues, and poor matchmaking experiences. The player base is frustrated and demoralized, and it shows in how people behave during matches. Once, the competitive nature of CS brought out the best in players, creating an environment of skill and camaraderie. Now, it’s all about getting through the match without tearing your hair out.

The introduction of the new matchmaking system has only made things worse. The rankings feel inconsistent, and there are so many smurf accounts—players intentionally playing at lower levels to dominate newbies—that it’s impossible to climb without running into wall after wall. It’s made the competitive scene feel pointless, with no real progression.

In Conclusion: A Franchise in Decline
After hundreds, maybe thousands of hours spent in the Counter-Strike series, I never thought I’d be here, completely disillusioned and frustrated with the state of the game. Counter-Strike 2 has taken everything that made the franchise great and run it into the ground. What was supposed to be a promising evolution of the series has instead resulted in an unoptimized, broken, and increasingly unpopular title.

It’s hard to recommend the game to anyone anymore. I still have hope that Valve will turn things around, but with each passing update, it feels more like they’re ignoring the core issues that the community is pleading for them to address. Until that happens, Counter-Strike 2 remains an absolute disaster of a release—unplayable, unbalanced, and unrecognizable as the game we all loved.",False,True,"Performance Optimization Nightmare `` cs2 experience '' Counter-Strike 2 first teased , high hopes . game supposed `` next-gen , '' improved graphics , smoother gameplay , advanced technology ’ pushed franchise future .

730,"[h1]Honest CS2 Review from a player with a combined 10 years of CS experience, across all games. Yes, even Nexon.[/h1]

CS2 is.... so god damn bittersweet to play. The graphics and particles, are amazing. Truly something I would've only dreamed of when I was an 11 year old boy and played CS:GO for the first time. The skins look better than ever with this new revamped lighting, and it's easier than ever to get into the game.

[h2]The new and ""improved"" ranking system[/h2] 

To call this system improved is... a half truth. Yes, it's more specific to maps, but also makes it EXTREMELY difficult to truly keep track of your skill level, unless you exclusively play premier. This also kinda segues into my issue with the SBMM in normal competitive mode, as if ONE person on your team is Gold Nova on that map, and the rest of you are unranked or Silver 1, the odds of the enemy team having multiple players matching your most powerful player's skill level is very high. 

[h2]The bugs. Dear Christ, the bugs.[/h2]

Where in the name of Christ do I start? For every bug fixed from CS:GO, 2 more appear in this game. Sure, most of them get patched quickly, but the ones that stay are absolutely foul. It's not uncommon for your game to get stuck in the ""CT Side"" or ""T Side"" opening cutscene, rendering you useless until you rejoin the match. 

WHICH, leads me to the next point. Sometimes, (more often than not) should you have to rejoin a competitive or premier match, clicking ""reconnect"" has a very high chance of registering your click, starting the loading timer, but not loading you in. It will seriously sit there and count for the entirety of your re-join timer, at which point it will give you an abandonment cooldown. This can only be fixed by restarting your entire game and trying to connect again, BEFORE THE TIMER RUNS OUT, or very quickly cancelling the load by leaving the party, and clicking ""reconnect"" again.

 [h2]Bots. All the bots. More robots than an unmanned assembly line up in here.[/h2] 

Whether you join a casual match and find a bot-farm match, kicking you almost immediately, or you have someone on your comp queue that has an autoclicker simply to avoid an idling kick so they can farm XP, there is no shortage of bots in this game unless you're full-stacked in a competitive gamemode, or you avoid Deathmatch, Casual, and Arms Race altogether outside of private matches. Admittedly, this problem has lessened in the past couple months. 

 [h3]Summary[/h3]

Despite my harsh words about the game, I think most of it's downfalls can be attributed to it's somewhat rushed release. If this game wasn't damn near Cyberpunk level rushed, I doubt I'd have much to talk about here. All in all, it's still the same old CS you know and love if you're looking for a competitive FPS game to kill time with some friends and hear users from around the world call you slurs you've never even heard of. If you can look past the ""quirks"" and enjoy the new features and GORGEOUS new lighting, you'll have a blast. If fancy lighting and smoother utility sprites can't hold you over, don't install it.",True,True,"[ h1 ] Honest CS2 Review player combined 10 years CS experience , across games . Yes , even Nexon .

It's that little voice in your head whispering, ""What if you're the chosen one?"" — like some kind of divine force is guiding your broke a$$ to financial freedom through a rigged slot machine called ""Lucky Leprechaun Megaways."" The fun isn't even about winning — it's the five-second fantasy before the result hits. That moment where your whole life flashes before your eyes, imagining the casino calling you sir and not just another dumbahh funding their electricity bill.

You don't even need to hit big — a little win will have you out here feeling like the Wolf of Wall Street off a $10 profit. Then the casino reels you in, lets you taste heaven before slapping you back to reality with three empty spins in a row. But you keep going, because the next spin might just be The One. You know it's rigged, you know the house always wins, but your brain doesn't care. It’s all dopamine and delusion, baby.

What's worse is the more you lose, the funnier it gets. That self-aware, broke man laughter when you're down to your last $5, betting it all on some cartoon fruit slot like your ancestors didn't fight wars for this. And when you inevitably lose, you reload your balance while mumbling, ""Just one more deposit, I'm actually feeling lucky this time.""

Gambling is bad for your wallet, your mental health, and probably your whole bloodline — but holy shiii, the ride is immaculate. Nothing makes you feel more alive than losing money you didn't even have in the first place.

730,"Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) is the highly anticipated upgrade to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO), developed by Valve. Running on the Source 2 engine, CS2 brings visual improvements, better responsiveness, and new gameplay mechanics while maintaining the core tactical shooter experience that has defined the franchise for years.

Positive Aspects:
✅ Enhanced Graphics and Visual Effects – With improved lighting, textures, and realistic smoke grenades, CS2 looks significantly better than CS:GO while still running smoothly.

✅ Same Classic, Addictive Gameplay – The core gunplay and tactical elements remain intact, ensuring CS2 retains the fast-paced, skill-based experience that fans love.

✅ Updated Smoke Mechanics – The new volumetric smokes react dynamically to bullets and grenades, adding fresh tactical depth to matches.

✅ Better Performance and Tick Rate – The game features a new sub-tick system, making movement and shooting more responsive compared to CS:GO.

✅ Free Upgrade for CS:GO Players – Since CS2 replaces CS:GO, existing players get access to the new game without additional cost.

Negative Aspects:
❌ Limited Features at Launch – Some popular features from CS:GO, like game modes and maps, were initially missing or limited in CS2, frustrating long-time players.

❌ Hit Registration and Tick Rate Concerns – While the new tick system is designed to improve gameplay, some players report inconsistent hit registration and performance issues.

❌ Adjustments to Movement and Gunplay – The slightly altered movement and recoil mechanics feel different from CS:GO, leading to a learning curve for veteran players.

Final Verdict:
Counter-Strike 2 is a visually and mechanically refined upgrade to CS:GO, offering improved graphics and fresh gameplay elements while staying true to its tactical shooter roots. However, with missing features and some performance inconsistencies at launch, it still has room for improvement. If you're a Counter-Strike fan, CS2 is definitely worth playing, but expect some growing pains as Valve continues to refine the experience. 🎯🔥",True,True,"Counter-Strike 2 ( CS2 ) highly anticipated upgrade Counter-Strike : Global Offensive ( CS : GO ) , developed Valve .

Sub-tick system? Feels more responsive now.
New smokes & grenade physics? Best change in the game.
Gunplay & hit reg? Different, but I’m getting used to it.
Graphics & UI? 100% better than CS:GO.
Performance? Runs great, and I don’t even have a gaming PC.
Matchmaking? Fair 80% of the time, but could improve.
Cheaters? Still there, but not too often—feels the same as before.
Maps? Great updates, but please bring back Cache!
Overall, CS2 is on the right track. With more updates, it could surpass CS:GO completely.

730,"This is a though one.
The gameplay is a depature from CS:GO in minor ways, that makes a major difference. The way your pc opperates with the server, and through to the other clients, is different from CS:GO. It has given a lot of advantage to the T-side. Combined with the MR-12 format the balance of CS2 feels off. 
But that is not why I would not recommend the game, as it is just the flavour of gameplay.

I DO NOT recommend this game because of instability issues. What is causing this i do not know. The game crashes to often.

730,"[h1] Steam Review of Counter-Strike 2 - By Sir Winston Churchill [/h1]

My dear comrades of the digital battlefield, I must declare, with all the certainty of a well-placed AWP shot, that Counter-Strike 2 is a most exhilarating and marvelous engagement of skill, strategy, and sheer unrelenting chaos.

From the very moment one steps foot upon the sacred grounds of Dust2 or ventures into the shadowy corners of Inferno, a most peculiar sensation arises—one of both supreme exhilaration and inevitable frustration. For indeed, in the realm of Counter-Strike, glory and despair walk hand in hand, much like an eco round and an overconfident rush into certain doom.

The bugs? The glitches? Oh, my dear allies, they are but the charming imperfections of a war-torn veteran, scars upon a battlefield that has stood the test of time. They do not hinder the experience but rather enhance it—each unexpected physics mishap, each lag-spike disaster, a new chapter in the annals of Counter-Strike history. And as for the hackers and the wallers? They are the natural opposition, the ever-present force that, while loathed, serves as a most excellent antagonist in our collective struggle.

Yet, despite the odds, we fight on! For no matter where you hail from—be it the rolling hills of England, the frozen steppes of Russia, or the sunlit coasts of Brazil—every man and woman understands the sacred objective: plant the bomb or defuse it, hold the site or take it, clutch or be clutched upon. And in this shared understanding, we are united, even as we scream most colorful obscenities at one another across voice chat.

And oh, the thrill of victory! When a plan unfolds with perfect execution, when the final kill is secured in a most dazzling display of skill, it is as if a great campaign has been won, and the digital world bows before you in triumph. But even in defeat, there is laughter—whether at the misfortunes of professionals faltering on the grandest stages, or at the content creators who bravely dare to queue into the madness, entertaining us with their folly and triumph alike.

From the opening of cases, an act akin to gambling with one's very soul, to the grand spectacles of international tournaments, Counter-Strike 2 remains a monument to the enduring spirit of competition. And in this, I must tip my hat to the architects of our warfare—Valve, that most enigmatic and mysterious entity, who, for all their peculiar silences and eccentric ways, have ensured that Counter-Strike endures.

That we find ourselves in 2025, still wielding our rifles and executing our tactics, is nothing short of remarkable. A most glorious time to be alive, my friends.

Well done, Valve. Well done, GabeN.

730,"**Title: Still a Classic, But Seriously, Fix the Bugs**

*Counter-Strike 2* had a lot to live up to, and while it’s not *bad*, it’s frustrating to see that the devs haven’t ironed out some pretty glaring issues that *should* have been addressed before launch.

First off, the gameplay itself is solid. The core mechanics of *Counter-Strike* are still intact—team-based, tactical action that rewards precision and strategy—but the transition to the Source 2 engine seems rushed in some places. Sure, the graphics are stunning and the maps look better than ever, but it feels like the game is still a bit... unfinished.

Let’s talk about **server stability**. I’ve had multiple matches where the game randomly stutters or freezes for a second, only to have me die in the most frustrating ways. And don’t get me started on the **hit registration**—sometimes it feels like you’re firing directly at someone’s head, only for the bullets to somehow miss. In a game where split-second decisions matter, that’s a major problem. It’s like the game is actively punishing you for trying to play at a high level.

Also, the **balance issues** are all over the place. Some weapons feel either way too strong or way too weak. The new economy changes feel odd, and I’ve had plenty of matches where I was stuck in a bad situation simply because the new weapon system feels unbalanced. There’s a lot of work to do here before it feels like a fair game for all players, not just the ones who exploit the most broken weapons.

Let’s not forget the **anti-cheat**. It’s a big talking point, and while it’s definitely better than *CS:GO’s*, there are still cheaters getting through, and that’s beyond frustrating when you’re trying to enjoy a competitive match. The matchmaking also has its issues—sometimes you’ll end up in games with completely unbalanced teams, making the entire experience feel like a waste of time.

Finally, the **UI and menus** feel clunky. It's like they didn’t take enough time to make navigating the game smooth. Sometimes I’ll get stuck on loading screens or accidentally click the wrong button because it’s not intuitive. It’s minor, but it adds up to an overall frustrating experience.

**Pros:**
- Classic *Counter-Strike* gameplay that still works
- Stunning graphics, Source 2 engine really shines
- Good core mechanics

**Cons:**
- **Serious server issues** (lag, freezes, stutters)
- **Hit registration problems**—feels like bullets don’t register at times
- **Weapon and economy imbalance** ruins the flow of matches
- **Anti-cheat isn’t perfect**—cheaters still find their way through
- **UI and menus** are clunky and unintuitive
- **Unfinished feel**—it’s clear the game still needs a lot of polish

Ultimately, *CS2* could be great if the devs actually put in the work to address these issues. Right now, it’s hard to recommend to anyone who wants a smooth, balanced experience. If you’re a *Counter-Strike* fan, there’s still fun to be had, but be prepared for a lot of frustration along the way.

- It also wasn't fun to loose all the achievements after GO and don't have anything in return besides the single stub.
- Bots are stupid. Like much more stupid than was in Source. And there is no real way to configure them. I believe there was an option in CSGO, which doesn't works now.
- There is also no more way to pick a specific map in casual, only groups, which is a bit annoying.

578080,"PUBG was once a fantastic game. If you had asked me seven years ago what I thought about it, I would have told you it was one of the best battle royale games especially if you had a good group of friends to play with. However, the current state of the game is absolutely terrible. First and foremost, the optimization is still awful. The game runs poorly even on high end systems, which is unacceptable at this point. On top of that, the matchmaking is completely unfair. If you're a new player trying PUBG for the first time, you'll be thrown into lobbies filled with veterans who have been playing for years. As a result, you stand no chance. The moment you land, you're eliminated almost instantly, making it nearly impossible to enjoy or learn the game. I'm not saying PUBG was ever a perfect game, but at least it used to be fun and offered an enjoyable experience. You could have great laughs with friends, and the game felt rewarding. What bothers me the most about modern PUBG is that the developers seem desperate to turn it into something similar to Fortnite. This is most evident in the excessive focus on cosmetic items skins, outfits, and weapon designs that feel completely out of place in a game that originally prided itself on a more realistic battle royale experience. Another frustrating change is the lack of map selection. In the past, players could choose which map they wanted to play on, but now the game forces you into a random one. This removes a level of control and strategy that was once part of the experience. Had I written this review several years ago, I would have wholeheartedly recommended PUBG. Unfortunately, in its current state, I simply cannot.

578080,"I saw this game a long time ago before the rise of Fortnite and it was the perfect way to showcase a battle royale at the time, however throughout the years the game has been treated so poorly that you are constantly being gouged down with stuff to purchase that doesn't even look good or fitting at all for the game's aesthetic.

Along with this while playing the game directly you constantly run into mayor performance issues where parts of the map don't load properly giving other players an advantage over you. Out of nowhere you will get massive lagspikes where the game updates 1 frame every 3-5 seconds and these last well over a minute which is more than enough time to call the match over for you in a pinch. Not to mention that one moment the game could be fine and then your ping will spike to over +2000 and give you bad connections, making it very difficult to play the game with friends without lag and performance ruining the experience.

The game had a lot of potential but in it's current state the game is pretty much unplayable due to the overwhelming performance issues it has and thhe refusal of the devs to take any action against it.

I like(or liked) the game, its fun, fairly realistic and when it comes to sounds and weapons not bad at all.
But, it is infested by cheaters, not just meeting one every now and then, they are in every match and are apparently allowed to cheat as they are almost never permanently banned. 
And no, you can not learn the skill of being able to see your enemies behind solid objects out of hearing distance, tracking them just to let out a no recoil full auto head shoot at 100m, No one can(check the replay and toggle x-ray on and off, then its easy to see if they are cheating).

The cheating seams to come and go, some times less, sometimes totally unplayable and it is always worst at the asian servers.
Add to that a lot of server down time, high ping and package loss.

But when there occasionally is less cheaters and the servers are  functioning properly, it is a great game.
I would pay (again)for the possibility to play the game with a functioning anti cheat system, fast servers and Vac bans implemented.

578080,"PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS – The OG Battle Royale That Started It All

Ah, PUBG. The game that made Winner Winner Chicken Dinner a phrase worth fighting for. If you've spent 202.5 hours in this war-torn, loot-scavenging, tension-filled world, then you know the drill: Drop. Loot. Shoot. Pray the circle favours you. But does PUBG still hold up in 2025, or has it been outgunned by newer battle royals? Let’s break it down.  

---

The Good Stuff 

✅ Realistic, Intense Gunplay  
PUBG doesn’t hold your hand—every firefight is high-stakes and tactically demanding. Whether it’s a long-range sniper battle or a last-circle shotgun duel, gunplay feels authentic and satisfying** (when desync isn’t ruining your day).  

✅ Diverse Maps & Gameplay Variety 
From the wide-open fields of Erangel to the close-quarters chaos of Sanhok, PUBG offers a variety of ways to die horribly—I mean, strategies to win. The evolving map pool keeps things fresh, even after hundreds of hours.  

✅ Adrenaline-Packed Moments 
PUBG’s magic lies in the tension. The sweaty-palmed final circles, the unexpected ambushes, the sheer panic when a squad rolls up in a UAZ—it’s an emotional rollercoaster every match.  

✅ Now Free-to-Play 
Since going F2P, the game is more accessible than ever. New players can jump in, though whether they’ll survive long enough to enjoy it is another question.  

---

The Not-So-Great Stuff 

❌ Bugs, Glitches, & the Occasional Rage-Inducing Desync  
PUBG has improved massively since its early days, but let’s be real—it’s still got jank. Bullets sometimes refuse to hit targets, vehicles behave like haunted rollercoasters, and you will** die to the blue zone because your vault animation bugged.  

❌ Steep Learning Curve (Especially for New Players)
PUBG doesn’t throw flashy abilities or easy mechanics at you. It’s a brutal, skill-based game that rewards experience—but that also means new players get destroyed instantly. If you're not a veteran, expect to spectate a lot at first.  

❌ Cheaters & Hackers Still Exist
Even with anti-cheat improvements, hackers occasionally turn a promising match into a ""well, that was pointless"" experience. Nothing ruins PUBG faster than getting lasered by some wallhacking tryhard.  

❌ Pacing Issues (AKA 20-Minute Looting Simulations)
Sometimes, you spend **half a match looting, finding zero enemies—only to get third-partied the moment you engage in a fight. It’s the PUBG experience in a nutshell: hours of patience, moments of panic, and seconds of pure regret.

---

Final Verdict: Should You Play It?

If you love tactical, high-risk firefights, PUBG is still one of the most intense shooters out there. The gunplay is top-tier, the maps keep evolving, and every match tells a different story—sometimes tragic, sometimes hilarious. But it’s not for the faint of heart. The game can be brutal, frustrating, and buggy, but if you’ve stuck with it for over 200 hours, you already know the struggle.  

Score: 8/10 – Still one of the best, but prepare for pain.

Look, I get it. The core gameplay is still kinda fun, like watching a squirrel try to bury a nut. But then, BAM!

Sometimes, you get a chicken dinner. (Rare, like seeing a unicorn riding a bicycle.)

What was once a promising battle royale experience has turned into an absolute mess of unoptimized gameplay, unbalanced mechanics, and a developer team that seems to have no idea what they’re doing.

Let’s start with the controls—because they feel like they were designed by someone who has never played a shooter in their life. Movement is clunky, aiming is awkward, and don’t even get me started on the horrendous gunplay. Half the time, you’ll be fighting against the game’s own janky physics rather than actual opponents.

Oh, and the bugs? PUBG has more bugs than a decaying swamp. You’ll find yourself stuck in walls, rubberbanding across the map, or even dying to invisible enemies because the servers run like they’re being powered by a potato. Speaking of servers—why does a game this old still suffer from lag and desync issues? It’s ridiculous.

And let’s not forget the cheaters. PUBG is INFESTED with hackers, and the anti-cheat system is about as useful as a wet paper bag in a hurricane. Expect to be headshotted from across the map by someone using an aimbot while the developers do nothing about it.

Graphics? Outdated. Gameplay? Repetitive. Updates? Usually break more than they fix. Honestly, PUBG feels like it should have been left behind in 2018. There are way better battle royale games out there, and yet this one somehow still clings to life like a rotting corpse refusing to die.

The maps are large, varied, and beautifully designed, offering plenty of opportunities for ambushes, sneaky plays, or all-out combat. The shooting mechanics feel solid, and the gunplay has a satisfying weight to it, with a wide range of weapons and attachments to choose from. Whether you’re going for a long-range sniper shot or close-quarters combat, the game offers plenty of flexibility in playstyles.

The game has seen improvements over the years in terms of performance and stability, but it can still experience occasional lag, bugs, or frustrating glitches. The matchmaking can sometimes feel a bit slow, especially for solo players, and the community can be hit or miss, with the occasional toxic player ruining the experience.

That being said, PUBG remains one of the best battle royale experiences out there, especially if you enjoy tactical gameplay and a slower pace compared to faster, more arcade-like battle royales. It’s worth jumping in for the thrill of intense battles, and with regular updates and events, there’s always something to look forward to.

Pros:
✔️ Realistic gunplay and mechanics
✔️ Large, diverse maps with strategic depth
✔️ Intense and rewarding gameplay
✔️ Plenty of customization options
✔️ Free-to-play model (since 2022)

Cons:
❌ Can feel slow-paced for some players
❌ Occasional bugs and optimization issues
❌ Tough learning curve for newcomers
Review:

PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS is the game that started the battle royale craze, and despite the rise of competitors like Fortnite, Warzone, and Apex Legends, it still delivers a unique and intense experience. The game’s realistic gunplay, bullet physics, and vast open-world maps set it apart from its more arcade-like rivals. Whether you're sneaking through Erangel’s forests, battling in Miramar’s deserts, or surviving in Vikendi’s snowy landscapes, each match feels like a tactical challenge.

The tension of looting, positioning, and engaging in firefights is what makes PUBG stand out. Every decision matters, and a single mistake can send you back to the lobby. The introduction of new weapons, vehicles, and game modes has helped keep things fresh over the years. However, it still struggles with occasional bugs and performance issues, especially on lower-end PCs.

For newcomers, the game can feel punishing due to the high skill ceiling, but for veterans, that’s what makes every victory feel earned. If you’re a fan of realistic battle royale games and don’t mind the slow-paced, strategic nature of PUBG, it remains a solid choice even in 2025.

Would I recommend it? Yes, but only if you enjoy methodical and tactical shooters over fast-paced arcade-style action

Overall Rating: ★★★★☆

PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG), developed by KRAFTON, is one of the pioneers of the battle royale genre. Dropping into a massive open map with 99 other players, scavenging for weapons, and fighting to be the last one standing creates intense and unpredictable gameplay. While PUBG has seen competition from newer titles, it remains a thrilling and tactical shooter.

Gameplay & Gunplay: ★★★★★

PUBG is known for its realistic gunplay, which feels satisfying and skill-based. Weapons have distinct recoil patterns, bullet drop, and attachment customization, making combat both challenging and rewarding. The game also features multiple large maps with varied environments, requiring players to adapt their strategies.

Survival & Tension: ★★★★★

Unlike faster-paced battle royales, PUBG focuses on tactical survival. The pacing is slower, with a strong emphasis on positioning, sound awareness, and smart decision-making. The tension of being the last player alive in a final-circle showdown is unmatched.

Graphics & Performance: ★★★☆☆

While PUBG has improved visually over the years, it still struggles with optimization. Even high-end PCs can experience stutters, and console versions have performance issues. The game’s visuals are decent, but the occasional glitches and slow rendering can be frustrating.

Updates & Community: ★★★☆☆

KRAFTON regularly updates PUBG with new content, including weapons, maps, and modes. However, matchmaking can be inconsistent, and the player base has declined since its peak. The community is passionate but can be toxic, especially in ranked play.

Overall Verdict:

PUBG remains a tense and rewarding battle royale experience, with fantastic gunplay and deep tactical gameplay. While its performance issues and declining player base hold it back, it’s still an excellent choice for those who enjoy realistic, high-stakes survival shooters.",True,True,"[ h1 ] PUBG – Battle Royale Started [ /h1 ] Overall Rating : ★★★★☆ PlayerUnknown ’ Battlegrounds ( PUBG ) , developed KRAFTON , one pioneers battle royale genre .

With the worst possible optimization for AMD graphics cards, the frame rate you can get against Nvidia graphics cards is almost 1/3 lower, and its CPU consumption cannot be ignored at all. If you have an old processor, you should avoid running this game! If you have overclocked it, you should return it to the  factory defaults, otherwise 2 minutes after entering the game, you will get nothing but a crash(even inside the manu). DirectX 12 is also nothing more than a joke and the game still requires a high power single core processor to get a higher frame rate.

Because after 2-3 minutes, the textures will not load in high resolution, and this process will be repeated even in subsequent matches!

Overall Rating: ★★★★☆

PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG) revolutionized the battle royale genre, bringing large-scale survival gameplay to the mainstream. Despite competition from newer titles, PUBG still offers a tense and rewarding experience with its realistic gunplay, vast maps, and strategic depth. However, technical issues and optimization problems continue to hold it back.

Gameplay & Gunplay: ★★★★★
PUBG shines with its realistic gunplay, diverse arsenal, and tactical gameplay. Every bullet has weight, and mastering recoil control is essential. The game rewards strategic positioning, teamwork, and patience, making each match an intense experience.

Maps & Variety: ★★★★☆
With multiple maps like Erangel, Miramar, Sanhok, and Vikendi, PUBG offers different playstyles, from long-range desert battles to close-quarters jungle fights. The variety keeps the experience fresh, but some maps are less balanced than others.

Graphics & Performance: ★★★☆☆
While PUBG has improved its visuals over time, optimization remains an issue. Frame rate drops, desync, and occasional bugs can disrupt the experience, especially on lower-end systems. The mobile version, surprisingly, runs smoother than its PC counterpart.

Matchmaking & Cheaters: ★★★☆☆
Cheating has been a persistent problem in PUBG. While anti-cheat measures have improved, hackers still plague matches, making some games frustrating. Matchmaking can also be inconsistent, with bots appearing in lower-rank lobbies.

Overall Verdict:
PUBG remains a solid battle royale game with realistic combat, deep strategy, and high replayability. However, optimization issues and cheaters continue to be major drawbacks. If you’re looking for a tactical, high-stakes battle royale, PUBG is still one of the best—just be prepared for some frustrating moments.",True,True,"[ h1 ] PUBG – Battle Royale Pioneer [ /h1 ] Overall Rating : ★★★★☆ PlayerUnknown ’ Battlegrounds ( PUBG ) revolutionized battle royale genre , bringing large-scale survival gameplay mainstream .

Learning curve for gear, guns,attachments, and maps are satisfying to master.  And vehicles man... they actually matter during a match, and handle intuitively for mouse & keyboard players. As for replay value, maps are huge and keep rotating,so i'm still figuring them out.

578080,"In my opinion the game has gotten far too competitive for my taste.
This is just my opinion but I feel like this game struggles with something similar to alot of once popular shooters that lose traction and develop a loyal playerbase. Lobbies fill up with bots and the real people are really good on average.
I started playing after the big hype back in 2017, so around 2021/2022 ish. I didn't realize the first few games were bot matches so I hopped in and got around 7-11 kills per game so I felt pretty confident and was enjoying the game, but when I entered real matches I got ABSOLUTELEY CLAPPED. 
Listen, I'm not an FPS pro by any means but I have been playing FPS games for many years, but none of it carried over when fighting these guys. Getting shot from 800m away, from bushes/trees, while driving at 95 kmph and being one pumped around corners was a big deterrent for me when I hopped into real games.
Even my buddy with around 1k hours was getting pulverized too, once we hopped into duos lobbies.

No hate for any PUBG players still out there, you guys are insane, but personally it's too competitive for me or my friends to hop on sadly (I'll probably stick to climbing CS if I'm feeling FPS)",False,True,"opinion game gotten far competitive taste . opinion feel like game struggles something similar alot popular shooters lose traction develop loyal playerbase .

Loaded into my first match it completely froze on me, even closing from task manager is doing nothing. I needed to fully restart my brand new PC just to get rid of it.

578080,"This game is one of the most well-known battle royale games on Steam. Even though it has been around for years, many players still enjoy it. The game offers intense gunfights, strategic gameplay, and a realistic survival experience.

There are many game modes that we can play, but the main one is battle royale. You drop onto a big map with 99 other players, loot weapons and gear, and try to be the last one standing. There are also ranked matches for more competitive players and arcade modes like Team Deathmatch for who want to play in a quick match.

The gunplay is one of the best things about this game. The weapons feel powerful, and the shooting mechanics are very realistic. If you like tactical shooters, you will enjoy the challenge. However, the game can sometimes feel slow, especially when you spend a long time looting and then die in one second.

The game community still has an active player base, but the community is mixed. There are many skilled players, but also a lot of hackers, especially in ranked games. The developers do ban cheaters, but it feels like there are always more coming.

Playing with friends is the best way to enjoy the game. Solo games can be frustrating, but if you have a squad, the game becomes a lot more fun. You can work together, make plans, and have funny moments.

One of the biggest problem in PUBG is toxic players, especially asian gamers. Many players spam the voice chat, scream, or just ruin the game for others. If you don’t mute them, they can be really annoying. Some also team up unfairly in solo mode, which makes the game frustrating.

Of course, not all players are bad, but the problem is common. Maybe developers could fix this by improving the reporting system or adding better region filters.

The graphics still look good, but the game is not well optimized. Even for the good PC. If you configure your graphics to be high but your opponents set it to be very low, they can see you better in some angles.

Lastly, I would say that this game still a fun battle royale game, but it has some issues. The gameplay is great, but the community, cheaters, and toxic players can ruin the experience. If you enjoy tactical shooters and can handle the problems, PUBG is still worth playing. But if you want a smoother experience, other battle royale games might be better.",True,True,"game one well-known battle royale games Steam .

578080,"What I Love:

✅ Tactical Gameplay – Unlike more arcade-style BR games, PUBG forces you to play smart. Positioning, sound cues, and map knowledge matter more than just raw aim. Every decision—whether to engage or hide—can determine your fate.

✅ Diverse Maps – From the classic Erangel to the fast-paced Sanhok and the open Miramar, each map offers unique strategies. Vikendi's snowy landscapes and Taego's Korean setting also add variety.

✅ Gunplay is Satisfying – The weapons feel great, and mastering recoil control is a skill in itself. No two fights feel the same, and every gunfight is a high-stakes encounter.

✅ Squad Play is a Blast – Playing with friends elevates the game. Communication, strategy, and clutch moments make every session memorable.
What Could Be Better:

❌ Optimization Issues – PUBG has improved over the years, but it can still feel clunky, especially on lower-end PCs. Occasional desync and lag can ruin critical moments.

❌ Steep Learning Curve – New players might struggle with the realistic mechanics, slow pacing, and punishing gunfights. It's not as pick-up-and-play as other BRs like Warzone or Apex.

❌ Bots in Some Matches – In lower ranks, bot-filled lobbies can make early games feel less exciting.
Final Thoughts:

PUBG may not be as flashy as newer battle royale games, but it remains one of the best for those who love tactical, high-risk gameplay. Whether you're playing solo, duo, or squad, every match tells a unique story.

578080,"[h1]PUBG: A Game That Should Have Died Already[/h1]

If you’re thinking about downloading [b]PUBG[/b], learning to play, and trying to get better—[i]don’t waste your time[/i]. Compared to any modern battle royale, this game is [b]complete trash[/b].

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Let’s Break It Down[/h2]

[list]
[*] [b]Bugs[/b] — Yes, there are plenty of them. While they don’t always ruin the gameplay, every glitch is a reminder: [i]“HEY, THE GAME IS 7 YEARS OLD!”[/i] And yet, it still feels [b]unfinished after all those patches[/b]. Embarrassing.
[*] [b]Right Peek Advantage[/b] — The only mechanic worth mastering because it’s an undeniable [b]imbalance[/b] that dominates the game.
[*] [b]Pay-to-Lose Economy[/b] — Dozens of pointless currencies, low drop rates for rare items, and [i]ridiculously overpriced cosmetics[/i]. Even by modern standards, the monetization here is straight-up robbery.
[*] [b]Complicated Gun Physics[/b] — Just to learn how to shoot properly, expect to spend at least [b]200 hours in training[/b]. Not exaggerating.
[*] [b]Cheaters Everywhere[/b] — You’ll encounter [i]multiple cheaters in nearly every match[/i]. It’s a fact.
[*] [b]Pointless Ranking System[/b] — It doesn’t affect matchmaking at all. Newbies end up playing against [b]5,000+ hour veterans[/b] with top-tier ranks. [i]Fun, right?[/i]
[*] [b]Random Matchmaking[/b] — No skill-based balancing whatsoever. Winning often depends on pure [b]luck[/b]: the zone, positioning, and weapons you find.
[/list]

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Want to Get Good? Good Luck...[/h2]

Just to be a [i]decent[/i] player (not even great), you’ll need to:

[list]
[*] Learn the ins and outs of [b]drops[/b] and pick the best landing spots.
[*] Master [b]looting[/b] quickly and efficiently.
[*] Understand every [b]weapon[/b] and nail down recoil control.
[*] Develop a feel for [b]distance[/b] and take [b]key positions[/b].
[*] Be ready to [i]adapt instantly[/i] to any situation.
[/list]

And that’s just the beginning. Yes, like every game requires effort — [i]BUT HERE, EVERYTHING IS DESIGNED TO FRUSTRATE YOU X100[/i].

[hr][/hr]

[h2]The Competitive Scene? Completely Dead[/h2]

Let’s not even talk about [b]pro play[/b], [b]competitive modes[/b], or [b]tournaments[/b]—because they’re [i]completely dead[/i]. There are maybe [b]one or two casual fan tournaments every couple of months[/b]. That's it.

If you’re hoping to dive into an exciting esports scene — [i]forget it[/i]. PUBG is nothing but a [b]ghost town[/b] when it comes to real competition.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Why Is PUBG Still Alive? A Mystery[/h2]

Honestly, [b]this game should’ve died a long time ago[/b]. The [i]only reason[/i] I keep playing is to team up with friends — because that’s the [b]only thing[/b] that makes this mess even remotely enjoyable.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Don’t Believe in Dreams of Skill[/h2]

If you watched [b]Recreant[/b] and think, [i]“I can do that too!”[/i] — [b]SPOILER ALERT![/b]

[quote]
[b]YOU. NEVER. WILL.[/b]  
It’s just not going to happen. Ever. Forget about it and move on.
[/quote]

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Final Verdict[/h2]

[b]PUBG[/b] survives purely on the [i]momentum of old players[/i] and the [i]occasional fun of playing with friends[/i].

Unfinished, unbalanced, flooded with cheaters, and featuring one of the worst monetization systems out there. Why anyone still plays this when there are far better battle royales available is a mystery I’ll never understand.

578080,"Ladies and gentlemen, fellow gamers, and dedicated PUBG players,


Today, we gather not just as mere gamers, but as champions of the virtual realm, united by our shared love for PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. We stand here, ready to embark on a new adventure, to conquer new frontiers, and to embrace the challenges of this immersive battleground. This isn't just a game; it's an experience, a test of skill, strategy, and teamwork.


PUBG has brought us together from all corners of the world. We have formed friendships, built alliances, and shared countless unforgettable moments on this digital battlefield. But today, I want to remind you of the true essence of PUBG, what makes it more than just a game. It's about teamwork, strategy, and most importantly, the thrill of the fight.


In PUBG, we are not just players; we are survivors. We are the brave souls who jump out of that plane, landing in an unknown land with nothing but our wits and a burning desire to be the last person or team standing. It's not just about shooting and looting; it's about making decisions under pressure, adapting to ever-changing circumstances, and achieving victory against all odds.


As PUBG players, we have faced countless challenges and adversities. We've faced fierce opponents, formidable obstacles, and heart-pounding encounters. But we keep coming back because we are determined, we are resilient, and we thrive on competition. We learn from our failures and celebrate our successes.


But remember, it's not just about individual glory; it's about teamwork. In squads and duos, we learn to trust each other, to communicate effectively, and to have each other's backs. In the world of PUBG, a well-coordinated team can overcome even the most daunting adversaries. So, let's continue to build our squads, nurture our friendships, and become even more formidable together.


As PUBG players, we understand that the journey is just as important as the destination. It's about the moments when your squad survives a hail of gunfire, the exhilaration of a well-earned chicken dinner, and the laughter and camaraderie we share in the process.


But remember, it's not just about the victories; it's about the sportsmanship. Let's remember to be good winners and gracious losers. Let's support each other, help newcomers, and build a positive and inclusive community.


So, fellow players, as we rally here today, let's remember why we fell in love with PUBG in the first place. It's about the thrill of the battle, the friendships we've forged, and the indomitable spirit that keeps us coming back for more. Let's keep pushing the boundaries of our skills, adapting to the ever-evolving battlegrounds, and continue to write our own epic stories on the virtual battlefield.

Stardew Valley was one of the best farming games I've ever played!!!
I have played this game for years and I still love it, I would highly recommend this game if you'd like to chill out/ relax, explore+discover, learn (I learned through this game a lot about farming, fishes, seasons), fight enemies, design, build a family and just have fun in this game! <3
And each character has their own story and not all of them are happy and peaceful some of them have a dark back story.
*And the game is only growing with the years (new updates)- Has new places to explore, new things to learn and meet new friends.

413150,"I truly believe Stardew Valley is one of the greatest video games ever created. (fairly obvious given its many imitators)

After logging several hundred hours a few years ago, I've returned to find what feels almost like an entirely new game. The content has expanded exponentially, giving it even more longevity & playability. It is a beautiful homage to Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing, and life in the PNW. If you are from Washington or Oregon such as myself. Stardew is incredibly nostalgic & comfy. 

Stardew also punches well above its weight in terms of character writing & a meaningful progressive message that does not feel awkward, self-referential, or forced. Stardew features a diverse cast of characters, & unlike other more explicitly ""wholesome"" games (Animal Crossing, Story of Seasons) its characters actually feel like real people. They experience grief, addiction, depression, & trauma, however, they [i]also[i/] experience realistic character growth. It is truly a deep joy seeing characters develop past adversity in this way. 

The mechanics of Stardew are also brilliant. It's very intuitive--some of its crafting recipes may be a little odd, but for the most part it's easy to learn the game's logic. Stardew is completely playable without tutorials or wiki searches, however, should you choose to use outside help there is a wealth of information regarding any questions you may have. You can go full grind mode & try to progress the story as much as possible, or take it easy & wander through life.

This game has brought me & my friends endless hours of entertainment, comfort, & relaxation.

The NPC's are really interactive and the game accommodates for a wide range of playstyle. You can work on your farm, fight monsters in the caves, create bonds with NPCs, fish for increasing difficult creatures, attend events, contribute to the community or sell it out to a large corrupt company.

In Stardew Valley, you can pet chickens. And this is no small feature that you might overlook. Oh no. You can actually shower these fluffy little creatures with love as if they were your very own personal pets. And the best part? They come in all sorts of colors! There are brown chickens, white chickens, black chickens, blue chickens, and even golden chickens! (And dinosaurs. Basically chickens!) It just feels amazing to pet a chicken while it struts around with its little, proudly puffed-up comb.

And if you think that's all there is to the chickens, you haven't discovered the eggs yet. You can collect these little goodies, sell them, or just feed them to your pals. Chickens are basically the unsung heroes of the game. And honestly, who needs the rest of the game when you have such a great chicken to brighten your day?

Okay, okay – the rest of the game is pretty nice too. You can build your own piece of land, catch fish, plant trees, and deepen your relationships with the villagers. But let's be real, it's the chickens that really make the difference.

413150,"Stardew Valley: A Timeless Farming Adventure

Stardew Valley is a masterfully crafted farming simulation that blends charming pixel art, engaging gameplay, and heartfelt storytelling. Developed by a single person, Eric ""ConcernedApe"" Barone, the game stands as a testament to passion and dedication, offering a deeply rewarding experience that has captivated players worldwide.

At its core, Stardew Valley is a game about escaping the hustle of modern life to build a new home in a quiet rural town. Players inherit a run-down farm and are given the freedom to cultivate crops, raise animals, mine for resources, fish, forage, and even befriend (or romance) the locals. The game provides an incredible sense of progression, as every action contributes to the development of your farm and relationships with the community.

What makes Stardew Valley truly special is its depth. Beyond farming, the game offers intricate crafting, combat in the mines, an ever-changing calendar of festivals, and a compelling storyline tied to the mysterious Joja Corporation and the town’s struggle to thrive. Every season brings new crops, events, and challenges, keeping the gameplay fresh and exciting even after countless hours.

One of the most impressive aspects of Stardew Valley is its balance between relaxation and engagement. The days pass quickly enough to encourage strategic planning, yet the game never feels punishing. The soundtrack, composed by Barone himself, perfectly complements the cozy atmosphere, making every moment feel warm and nostalgic.

Multiplayer adds another layer of enjoyment, allowing friends to collaborate and share the farming experience. The game’s active modding community further expands its possibilities, offering new mechanics, visuals, and features for those looking to customize their journey.

After achieving 100% completion, I can confidently say that Stardew Valley is one of the most rewarding and fulfilling gaming experiences available. It is a beautifully crafted world that invites players to create their own stories, filled with joy, challenge, and personal achievements. Whether you're a casual player looking for a relaxing escape or a completionist aiming for perfection, Stardew Valley delivers in every way.

413150,"Stardew Valley is a game in which you build and maintain a thriving farm. You will be planting crops, raising animals, fishing, mining, and crafting useful tools and machines. In the beginning, you’ll find yourself clearing weeds, chopping wood, and watering crops by hand, but before long, you can transform your small plot into a flourishing homestead, complete with automated sprinklers, artisan goods production, and even a bustling community of friends and farm animals. However, nature has its own rhythm, and the changing seasons bring new challenges and opportunities, encouraging you to adapt and grow.

Join forces with other players in cooperative Multiplayer, where you can build up your farm together, share responsibilities, and explore the world side by side. Add mods to enhance your experience, from small quality-of-life improvements to full-fledged expansions that add new crops, festivals, and mechanics. While the core gameplay is an open-ended farming adventure, there are a variety of interesting activities, including mysterious caves to explore, friendships to forge, and even a corporation to resist.

413150,"Stardew Valley is hands down my favorite go-to game whenever I need to unwind or take a break from the more intense games I play. It’s my personal sanctuary. There’s something incredibly soothing about spending time on my little farm, whether I’m planting crops, tending to animals, or fishing in the peaceful rivers of Pelican Town. The game’s pace is slow and relaxing, which makes it the perfect escape when I’m tired or need to take a breather from fast-paced, action-packed games.

The beauty of Stardew Valley is how it allows me to play at my own pace. There's no pressure, no rush, just me and my farm. The music is calming, the artwork is simple yet charming, and the characters are warm and engaging, which makes it feel like a cozy escape every time I play.

It's also the kind of game where I can just get lost for hours, getting into a rhythm of watering plants, making progress with friendships, and exploring the caves at my own leisure. Whether I'm tending to my crops or decorating my house, I always feel like I'm accomplishing something, even if it's just small, peaceful tasks.

413150,"🎮 Gameplay & Freedom:
Feels a bit privileged to even write a review for such a masterpiece... but here I go.
I absolutely love this game — the way you have so many options for how you want to play, and somehow all of those options feel meaningful. Every choice adds value to your experience.

✨ Play It Your Way:
Whether you’re farming, fishing, mining, building, exploring, or socializing — you can choose your own path, and it always feels rewarding.

📱 Cross-Platform Love:
I started playing on PC, and more recently, I’ve been enjoying it on mobile as well. No matter where I play, it’s a relaxing escape I can always return to.

❤️ Story & Characters:
The characters? They feel real. Their backstories are so immersive that you genuinely want to know more about them.

🧰 Automation & Late-Game:
One thing I love is how you can automate tasks that become repetitive in the late game — things like petting animals, collecting produce, and watering crops. It keeps the experience engaging even after hours of play.

📦 Inventory & Chest Management:
If I had to point out one thing I preferred in another game, it’s the chest organization. In Palia, for example, items are grouped automatically, and you can access your full inventory from any chest on your plot. I’d love to see something similar here — managing tons of chests in the late game can get overwhelming.

🎨 What Makes It Unique?
The 2D gameplay is part of its magic. It’s proof that a great game doesn’t need fancy 3D graphics to be captivating and addictive.

💰 Worth the money?
Without a doubt. This is a game I’ll keep coming back to for years.

It seems like the devs are playing a joke on the players (?)

Also, figuring the game out by yourself without looking at any internet spoilers including the wiki is all but impossible for everyone except the Try Hards with unlimited time to play.

413150,"Title: A Heartwarming, Addictive Farming Adventure - Stardew Valley Review

Stardew Valley is a true gem in the world of indie games, and it’s easy to see why it has captured the hearts of so many players, including myself. This charming farming simulator offers so much more than meets the eye, blending relaxing gameplay with a surprisingly deep and rewarding experience. I couldn’t put it down from the moment I started.

Gameplay and Mechanics: The game’s premise is simple yet addictive: inherit a rundown farm and transform it into something beautiful. But it’s the sheer variety of activities you can do that kept me coming back day after day. From planting crops, fishing, and raising animals to mining, crafting, and even building relationships with the townspeople, there’s always something to do. What I love most is how the game strikes the perfect balance between hard work and rewards — planting a crop and watching it grow, selling produce, or upgrading your farm feels so satisfying.

The daily rhythm of the game is incredibly relaxing but still offers a sense of accomplishment as you see your farm flourish. The seasons changing and the activities that come with them (like festivals, foraging, or the different crops) keep the game feeling fresh, no matter how many hours you put in.

Characters and Story: While Stardew Valley isn’t focused on a single narrative, the game’s strength lies in the town’s colorful cast of characters. Getting to know each of the villagers, building friendships (or even romancing them), and seeing how their lives unfold over time added a personal and meaningful touch to the game. I found myself looking forward to my interactions with them every day, as each character has their own quirks, backstory, and motivations.

Customization and Progression: One of the best parts of Stardew Valley is the sense of progression and customization. From designing your farm layout to choosing how to spend your time, every decision feels meaningful. The farming improvements and new areas to unlock give a sense of growth, and I loved seeing how my hard work paid off in the form of new abilities, tools, and opportunities.

Soundtrack and Atmosphere: The soothing soundtrack fits the game perfectly and adds to the overall sense of calm. The music sets the mood for each season and event, enhancing the experience. Whether I was working on my crops, exploring the mines, or simply relaxing at the local pub, the soundtrack never failed to immerse me in the world.

Overall Experience: Stardew Valley is a wonderfully wholesome experience that I recommend to anyone looking for a relaxing yet rewarding game. Whether you’re into farming sims or just want a game to get lost in, it’s a beautiful world that’s hard to leave once you’ve stepped inside. The attention to detail, the loveable characters, and the sense of community make it a must-play. It’s a game that allows you to play at your own pace, yet always feels engaging and rewarding.

If you haven’t tried it yet, do yourself a favor and start your own adventure in Stardew Valley — you won’t regret it.

413150,"Stardew Valley: The Most Stressful Relaxing Game You'll Ever Play

Imagine this: You escape the soul-crushing repetition of corporate life to inherit your grandpa’s rundown farm, expecting a peaceful, simple existence. Next thing you know, you're juggling crops, livestock, mining, fishing, fighting monsters, wooing villagers and single-handedly taking down a soulless megacorporation, all while an old man in a wizard hat spies on you from the woods.  

Stardew Valley pretends to be a chill farming game, but let’s be real, it's a capitalist pressure cooker in overalls. You start off thinking, “I’ll just plant some parsnips.” Then suddenly, you’re obsessing over optimal sprinkler placement, min-maxing ancient fruit profits and panicking because you forgot Mayor Lewis’s birthday (again).  

The villagers? They’re either delightful or deeply unhinged. You can befriend them, date them and even marry them, but fair warning: some of them have baggage heavier than a full backpack in Skull Cavern. (Looking at you, Shane.)  

And let’s talk about time. There’s never enough of it! You’ll wake up with big plans, get distracted by a truffle-hunting pig, and then realize it’s 2 AM and your farmer just collapsed in the dirt like a college student during finals week.  

But despite all this, Stardew Valley is weirdly, beautifully addictive. It's a pixelated love letter to hard work paying off, with a soundtrack so soothing it could calm a caffeinated squirrel. It’s part farming sim, part dungeon crawler, part small-town soap opera, and somehow, it all just works.

Its wonderful for escapism purposes, and I've been leaning on it pretty heavily for that reason over the last couple months. It is a cozy game and not terribly difficult, but there's enough going on to keep it interesting - it's not merely a farming simulator. That said, there's not pressure to ""progress,"" and potential goals of progression aren't even necessarily laid out for you so there's very little pressure to do anything you don't enjoy. If you want it just to be a farming simulator while you try to get as rich as possible - go for it! If you like fighting in the mines, that's an option, too! There's really no wrong way to play, and a lot of right ones.

413150,"Slept on this game for years, but finally picked it up because I was bored of basically everything else.  And wow, it has quickly become one of my favorite games.  Really wish I had bought it sooner.  I thought I would hate the repetitive farming aspect of it, but it oddly became quite addicting, quite quickly.  Establishing a daily routine of tending to the crops, growing the farm, maintaining relationships, and adventuring was unreasonably satisfying once I got into one.  All thanks to the insanely detailed and picturesque word, and characters that I instantly became attached to.  

Also, it's unfathomably based and has been so refreshing.  Ending up happily married with two kids and two dogs, on a $4M farm funded by cheese and truffle oil is a level of video game contentment I had yet to imagine.  Not only can you pet the dog, but you can kiss the wife and bounce the babies.  Like seriously, other video games, why can't I do that in your relationships?  I used to be fine with Skyrim marriage, but this is my new standard.  

All in all, this game is 10/10.  Will keep playing, and then play again.  It is so obvious that this game was made with an incredible amount of love, care, and attention to detail.  Huge, huge, props to ConcernedApe for making something this special.

I love this game, enjoy its leisurely pace, appreciate its freedom, and like being able to talk to the villagers without bringing in the deceit from reality. Getting married to an NPC of the opposite sex doesn't worry about being betrayed.
I also play Terraria and Minecraft. However, although both are pixel games, my computer can handle many entities in Terraria, and even harvesting a large amount of crops does not affect the game performance. But in Stardew Valley, when I plant too many crops and harvest them, or spray monster perfume in the skull cave to kill monsters, the game will keep freezing. Even worse, the game will crash and exit.
As mentioned above, I am annoyed by the game crashing repeatedly. Like today, the game crashed more than ten times, which greatly affects my gaming experience. I don't know how the entity of Stardew Valley operates, but this issue can be considered for proper resolution by the author.",True,True,"fact , feel confused game . put , actually play much longer time shown Steam , least several thousand hours . love game , enjoy leisurely pace , appreciate freedom , like able talk villagers without bringing deceit reality .

1091500,"I usually skip on playing action shooter games, that’s why I wasn’t that hyped when Cyberpunk was being released. It will haunt me forever to know that was it not for the Edgerunners anime, I would most likely not play this game at all. Missing out on this gaming jewel would truly be tragic. I am not being hyperbolic, the only critique I have for this game is the limited romance options, but I will spare everyone the several paragraphs about how unfair it is not being allowed to romance Viktor Vektor and Goro Takemura. To be completely honest, it is not even that big of a deal. In fact while the romance part of this game is cute, it could be skipped entirely without it taking away from the absolute perfection this game is.

What is so good about this game then? Well… kind of everything. 

Let’s start with world building, the year is 2077, future is here and almost everyone you meet on the street has some sort of cyber enhancement installed in their body. You are introduced to Night City, a brutal environment with several gangs plaguing each part of the city. I won’t spoil any part of the game in this review, but you are SHOWN just how dangerous this city is right from the very start, your first encounter, first mission. The characters, even those that only appear ever so often are wonderfully crafted with their own personalities and problems, making them unforgettable.

That brings us to narration, the main story left me giggling, ugly crying, gasping and staring with open mouth at the screen, I don’t remember the last time a game spurred this many different emotions within me. The dialogues are filled with witty lines and apart from your attitude and tone you use with people, there are choices to be made. Some will affect the outcome of a situation, some you might regret later. You are not pressured to follow the main story, in fact I have spent hours hunting side gigs and objectives before dedicating time to the main story. Even if not accompanied by ‘cutscenes’, the side gigs do offer a peek into the lore of the world you are in, they might even reveal things aren’t as they were presented to you. Of course due to the sheer number of these missions, some will be nothing more than a fetch quest with a little bit of extra story. I still found doing these enjoyable, probably for the sole reason of the freedom of choice. How do you want to do this? Enter guns blazing, grenades rolling, clean up the house to steal what you need? Or would  you rather sneak in, distract the guards and jump out of the window once you are done? Up to you.

 
So how is the combat? Incredibly satisfying. The options might even be a little overwhelming in the beginning. Do you want to hack or slash? Watch the chaos you sow erupt from the distance or bring the heat right to the gonk’s faces? There is abundance of weapons you can find or buy to suit any type of play style you like and if you don’t like weapons at all, you can make do with hacking the enemies’ cyberware or get a spicy little whip installed in your forearms. 

Equipped with whatever suits your fancy you get to explore the city and its surroundings, while you do get to fast travel and use other means of travel like cars or bikes, I often ran through the city by foot, there are so many places to discover, so many side quests, tidbits of lore or interesting weapons you might stumble upon. 

I do have to mention, however, that since the very… unfortunate… launch of this game, of which I heard about even if I wasn’t intending to play back then, there are still glitches and bugs. I did not encounter any game breaking ones and managed with a quick google search, but I do have a piece of advice - don’t lose yourself in the side gigs, whenever you have yellow side mission available - do those first. A lot of them are locked behind waiting for someone to call you, and I spent a long time trying to trigger this with no more side gigs available. 

And that is it my chooms, the past few weeks I have spent thinking about nothing else but Cyberpunk and now it is time to set the game down. I’ve completed what I wanted, looked up secrets I missed on my crawl through the Night City. But worry not, I have about fifty unreasonably long YouTube videos I shoved into my watch later playlist, analyzing all parts of the game to cope.

Fun large map lots of things to do. Find your own fun delving into different styles of combat. 
Are you the cool stealthy ninja? Or are you Rambo? Or perhaps a sniper? or mayber a glance at people and fry their cybernetics as a netrunner? Or go cyberpsycho?

Plenty of mods abound as well if you want to spice things up. 

Storywise - No spoilers here, writing makes sense, character development shown. Nothing forced. Pacing could be better but it does not feel rushed nor sluggish. Wish there were some follow-ups to see the consequences of some choices ala Witcher 3. Wish there were some other choices available when it logistically makes sense as well.

Voice acting is amazing and brings the characters to life. Keanu is breathtaking as well.

1091500,"Phenomenal game.
Yes, the story can be hard to follow.
Yes, the morality system (why knock people out?), the stealth gameplay (why hide bodies?), the character customisation (why can't I look like Jackie, Susie Q, or Maelstrom lol), the romance, trauma team, street cred (people should be afraid of me) etc. were all half-baked and clearly the Mox were going to be more important in the original scope and plans. But it shows how good the game is when all of this doesn't really matter or affect my view on it.

The gameplay is incredible. Truly amazing stuff. There is a triple combo that really allows for unique playstyles. 
1- cyberware
2- class-type skill trees
3- weapon type skills
 
On my first run I was a borged-out nomad netrunner-tank of a man, wielding nothing but a charge-shotgun with two barrels and a heart of hatred. The gameplay was on the highest difficulty but I still felt like Robocop. Blasting the shit outta gonks close range and blowing the brain-chips up of fools across the map with my quickhacks.

On my second run I was a double-jumping, quick-dashing mantis-blade streetkid woman that specialised in throwing knives, sniper rifles, pistols, and chopping fools up with my mantis blades. I had no ability to hack, and relied on a berserk booster for melee. This was an entirely different style of gameplay and is truly incredible the devs have built a system where it works and flows as naturally as it does. If I do a third run I'll play as a smart-gun, rifle-focused corpo. 

The open world is amazing, absolutely beautiful and with tonnes of detail. It truly defends its right to be open world with the NCPD scanner and gigs/jobs. It's a shame it doesn't have as much interactable establishments in any meaningful way (like eg. the Yakuza games) but still far better than 90% of open world games out there. I'd say as far as the map goes it is actually the best I have ever played. No Far Cry, Days Gone, Mad Max, Yakuza, GTA, Sleeping Dogs or whatever really gets close. This is something special.

The story is great, it's a decent foundation that is launched to its peak by the performances of its (voice)actors. This also applies to phantom liberty. The characters are well written and it punches where it needs to. It doesn't forget the PUNK of cyberpunk; even if the ""morals"" the story sort-of forces in your face are a bit dubious at best.

Overall, this game is definitely worth picking up. Especially considering you can get it at 50% off quite frequently. Make sure to get the one with Phantom Liberty as imho that expansion has an ending that is absolute cinema. 

So yes, TLDR:
GOATed story
GOATed open world design
GOATed side content
GOATed gameplay
GOATed soundtrack
MID character customisation (cmon man this is cyberpunk world, why do I gotta be normal skinny man/skinny woman?)
MID in some specific gameplay details (eg. stealth is still fun, but could be better)
SOUL CRUSHING axed content. Bruh, monowire hacking, mantis blade wall running, a moonbase etc. would be so cool

1091500,"[h3]This game has potential. [/h3]

The launch was not great and considering how long it was in development for, all the delays and excuses, this game was not ready for release. CDPR has, and hopefully at the end of this, will still have a brilliant reputation but I think games are being pushed too far in regards to over-hyping, advertising unrealistic gameplay/teasers and just generally releasing so broken.

Now, to the game:

[b][u] Pros [/u][/b]
- Great storyline, voice acting isn't the best.
- Some side-quests are really intriguing and can throw you from happy, to sad or leaving you confused but for good reason.
- Interactivity is okay, but there is enough to do in Night City. 
- Choices are thought-provoking though not overly too sure how they have an ultimate knock-on effect towards the end-game.
- Night City is beautiful and fast travelling doesn't seem needed, I can drive around the city and still be in awe even if I had driven down it so many times before. 
- The game immersion, aside from bugs, is okay, not brilliant but enough with how the story goes.
- Combat is as good as you'd expect although not RDR2 level.

[b][u] Cons [/u][/b]
- Promises of bustling city, but it's minimal people doing the exact same routine unless it involves them in a quest
- Cars randomly spawn upside down on the pavement and disappears or explodes, or cars spawn merged with other cars causing a complete eyesore and tear in immersion
- Character Customisation, we were promised it would be the best but I think I can name quite a few games off the bat that did it better.
- Cybernetics, supposed to be the pinical in Night City, but only offers bare minimum usage. All you need is a legendary weapon and things are just like hot knife through butter. Was expecting much more with Cybernetic...

[b][u] DLC- Phantom Liberty: [/u][/b]
The new golden standard for DLC. I felt like I was in a James Bond movie. The cast of characters are all extraordinary and well acted. During the middle of the dlc I felt like I was in the high stakes poker game from Casino Royale absolutely brilliant quest. Dog Town is the best district in Night City by far and is packed to the brim with new gigs, dungeons with dangerous bosses, new vehicle's and dozens of weapons and hundreds of new clothing items. This dlc easily offer's 30 plus hours of new content, and is a masterpiece!!!!

1091500,"The structure of Cyberpunk 2077 feels quite different from many RPGs I've played, including The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. While most games are designed like a tree, with a central story branching out into various paths, Cyberpunk 2077 resembles more of a sprawling bush. You don’t have to progress very far in the main quest before you encounter a dozen or more side activities, all vying for your attention. What's more, many of these opportunities are just a phone call away. In this futuristic world, quest givers often reach out to you directly, so you don't even need to go looking for them. This changes the usual sense of growth that RPGs offer, as the variety of options opens up quickly before leveling off for much of the game. Still, there’s so much to explore and discover, with plenty of hidden content you need to actively seek out, that I didn’t mind swapping that traditional sense of progression for the abundance of choices offered.",True,True,"structure Cyberpunk 2077 feels quite different many RPGs 've played , including Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt . games designed like tree , central story branching various paths , Cyberpunk 2077 resembles sprawling bush . ’ progress far main quest encounter dozen side activities , vying attention .

1091500,"One of the best gaming experiences I've ever lived. Night City consumes you, it makes you care for its people, its past and future, and your place in it. Keanu Reeves is embodying one of the best roles in his career, engaging with him is super fun. The rest of the cast stand their ground too, esp the protagonist/s and the DLC characters are believable to say the least.

You can approach this game as a role playing experience or a guns blazing shooter or a stealthy pacifist or... you get it. You can play the usual first-person shooter or develop complex synergies in your own unique build. You can customize your appearance infinitely, discover crazy rides, play a bunch of unique arcade mini games, discover subplots within subplots and never stop exploring.

This game has been stabilized since its despicable launch and right now looks and plays terrific. I can't imagine a realistic Cyberpunk universe looking better than this. If you own a high end pc, just GO FOR IT if only to witness its gorgeous lighting and reflections. The occasional bug is there but nothing game breaking and in the long run won't matter. Not to mention the development team is still updating the game, adding and fixing stuff 4+ years later and keeping the community active with new lore and photo contests or other gimmicks for hardcore fans.

A huge bonus is that the DLC is one of the best released; a compelling narrative with lots of different options, a higher Character Level Ceiling with a ton of new upgrades in weapons and cyberware and a whole bunch of new sidequests, gigs, vehicles and areas to explore.

Both the main game and the DLC can be replayed over and over and approached in different story-related choices or playstyles and feel refreshing and rewarding like a new experience.

Oh, and the soundtrack is NUTS. The game has been accused of being just a GTA clone with futuristic gear, but in reality its art style and sound design support the game's aesthetic perfectly to set it apart not only from GTA but also from the other genre defining titles like DEUS EX, exploring similar themes with a whole different approach.

1091500,"Cyberpunk 2077 has come a long way since launch, and I have to say—this game is now one of my all-time favorites. CD Projekt Red put in the work, and it really shows. If you love cyberpunk aesthetics, deep stories, and a world that feels alive, this is a must-play.

Night City is insane. The level of detail, the atmosphere, the way the city feels lived-in—it’s everything I wanted from a cyberpunk world. The neon lights, the shady alleyways, the high-tech skyscrapers, and the different districts all have their own unique feel. Walking through the streets, hearing conversations, and watching the chaos unfold around you makes it feel like a real place. It’s easy to get lost just exploring and soaking it all in.

The main story is fantastic, and the choices you make actually matter. Playing as V, trying to navigate the mess of Night City while dealing with Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves absolutely nailed the role) makes for an unforgettable experience. The game doesn’t hold your hand, and it throws a lot of moral dilemmas at you.

But what really makes the game special are the side characters. Panam, Judy, River, Kerry—they all feel like real people with their own problems and dreams. Some of the side quests are just as good, if not better, than the main storyline. The writing is just top-tier, and I found myself really invested in the characters and their stories.

The Phantom Liberty DLC takes everything great about Cyberpunk 2077 and turns it up even more. New missions, new characters (Idris Elba’s character Solomon Reed is my favourite), and new gear make this expansion worth every second. The espionage and action elements add a fresh twist, making it feel like a cyberpunk spy movie. If you already love the game, Phantom Liberty is a no-brainer.

Combat is a blast. Gunplay feels smooth, and melee combat is actually fun now. Hacking is one of my favorite parts—being able to take down enemies by messing with their cyberware or turning their own turrets against them never gets old. You can play this game however you want—sneaky netrunner, melee-focused street samurai, guns-blazing mercenary—it’s all viable, and it’s all fun.

Cyberware adds even more variety. You can install upgrades that let you jump higher, slow down time, or even rip enemies apart with Mantis Blades. The skill tree has been revamped too, making character progression way more rewarding.

Building your version of V is one of the best parts. Whether it’s how your character looks, what weapons you use, or what cyberware you install, there’s a ton of freedom to play how you want. The choices you make feel meaningful, and every build feels unique.

The music in this game is just perfect. Whether you’re walking through the streets, driving through the Badlands, or getting into a firefight, the soundtrack always fits the mood. The voice acting is fantastic across the board, and the ambient sounds of the city make it feel truly alive.

Visually, this game is stunning. With ray tracing and all the graphical updates, Night City looks breathtaking. Performance-wise, it’s night and day compared to launch—smooth, optimized, and finally what it was meant to be. If you’re playing on a decent PC or a next-gen console, you’re in for a visual treat.

Cyberpunk 2077 has gone from a troubled launch to one of the best RPGs I’ve ever played. The story, the world, the characters, the combat—it all comes together beautifully now.

1091500," this game quickly climbed into my TOP 5 games of all time. 
Cyberpunk is the most visually immersive and one of the most detailed games I have ever played, the graphics with PT and music are fantastic and the world building is something else.

It's not just simple futuristic aesthetics. I can feel the unique culture from within Night City, the different groups/gangs, the way people act, the slang they use, it all brings so much life to the world of Cyberpunk

the game bugs have significantly decreased and  story is just great, along with the amazing side missions and quests and gigs and and and... and don't let me get started on the Phantom Liberty expansion, LEVELS. The characters are really great as well, so many personalities to form connections with and plus, who doesn't want to play a game along side Keanu Reeves? Not to mention Idris Elba.

Really love the weapons and different play styles this game offers, from heavy assault with the baddest guns in town, to full on melee with your sharpest katana paired with your netrunning/hacking skills, or even take a stealth approach, the choice is yours.

Character customisation is just a delight and I enjoyed creating my different people.

1091500,"Cyberpunk 2077 is like a dystopian fever dream where you play as a mercenary named V, who’s basically a walking IKEA catalog of cyberware and poor life choices. The game is set in Night City, a place so grim it makes Blade Runner look like a Disney vacation. It’s a world where corporations rule, everyone has a tragic backstory, and your best friend is a gun that occasionally talks to you.

The story is a rollercoaster of emotions—mostly despair, with a side of existential dread. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, and you’ll question why you thought stealing a priceless relic from a megacorp was a good idea. Johnny Silverhand (played by Keanu Reeves, who’s basically playing himself but angrier) is your digital ghost roommate, and he’s either the best or worst part of the game, depending on how much you enjoy being called a ""gonk"" every five minutes.

Pros:

Night City is stunning when it’s not glitching into the void.

The soundtrack slaps harder than a cyberpsycho on a rampage.

Judy Alvarez exists. That’s it. That’s the pro.

Cons:

Bugs. So many bugs. I once saw a car phase through a building and honestly, it felt lore-accurate.

The AI is about as smart as a toaster. Cops will literally spawn behind you, yell ""STOP RIGHT THERE,"" and then forget you exist.

You’ll spend more time customizing your character than actually seeing them (thanks, first-person view).

In conclusion, Cyberpunk 2077 is a mess, but it’s our mess. It’s like dating someone toxic but hot—you know it’s bad for you, but you can’t look away. 7/10, would get cyberpsychosis again.",True,True,"Cyberpunk 2077 like dystopian fever dream play mercenary named V , ’ basically walking IKEA catalog cyberware poor life choices . game set Night City , place grim makes Blade Runner look like Disney vacation . ’ world corporations rule , everyone tragic backstory , best friend gun occasionally talks . story rollercoaster emotions—mostly despair , side existential dread . ’ laugh , ’ cry , ’ question thought stealing priceless relic megacorp good idea .

1091500,"The game is absolutely awesome! I have not been this hooked up to a video game for long time. I cant believe I held up so long to get it because of how this game was review bombed. It must have been over 2 years in my wishlist. Only shows how fans can be unfair sometimes.

Let's Start with Cons:
- Occasional bug and crash to desktop (happened maybe 2-3 times that the game flatlined). You can sometimes encounter wrecks of cars on the road which are not actual obstacles and cannot be interacted with, you can just drive through them like they were not there. From time to time you will see a flying object, levitating NPC or a car in really strange position.
- AI is superb dumb - police is the dumbest - even if you have 5 stars at being wanted they will forget about you in a minute or two if they cant see you. Even if you are just around a pillar and can see 5 policemen looking for you and slowly approaching your position then all of a sudden timer beeps, the stars start to flash for a few seconds and bang you are not wanted anymore. You go out of the pillar and policemen do not recognise you anymore even tho you just butchered a few dozens (or hundreds?) of their colleagues. I wish this could be addressed as it breaks immersion and is just straight out idiotic. Or when you enter the mission they stop chasing you. Not only police is stupid, all the enemies if they lose sight of you for a minute or something they lose interest or just stand there waiting to be smoked.
- You get too OP. I get that you are supposed to be a Night City Legend but the highest difficulty level should  be more challenging especially a little bit later when you get more cyberware and good weapons. For now game is only challenging on higher difficulties for the first few hours. Maybe until level 10 or 15. From level 40 you barely die and can just storm through 20 or 30 opponents. Only very occasionally you will die. 
- No flying machines that can be interacted with of piloted is a little disappointing in futuristic game like this. There should be flying cars or helicopters that could be piloted.

Pros:
- Story is amazing
- Most of the side quests are great and engaging. Even the repetitive quests like kill or steal are great because every time they are in different setting building etc and the gunplay never gets boring
- Gunplay is just great. Feels right maybe except for technical weapons which are not very fun. Also Melee weapons seems to be under-powered to compare them to shotgun for example
- NPCS are amazing so many memorable characters. 
- Voice acting is spot on
- Choices are good however there should be more 
- Romance option is thre and it is exciting
- Graphics is top notch
- Cars and driving feels great. Every car can be driven from 1st person perspective and every car has unique design with wheel radio and all interiors. How amazing is that?
- V - the protagonist is a cool interesting guy you can chose your starting position too
- Johnny Silverhand played by Keanu Reeves. How cool is this!
- Beautiful and alive city with so many people in and cars. So many unique districts 
- A lot of places where you can fight with lowlives just for fun without needing any quest
- Such a great music and variety. So many different radio stations
- You get a mobile phone! And can call or text other NPC! Cool
- Leveling system is good and rewarding.
- Quests are plentiful
- Almost no copy and paste buildings, cellars or locations. Everything feels unique

So much love was put into this game it is amazing. For me 9/10 - I dont mind an occasional bug but if they worked on poor AI and AI realism then it would be strong 9.5/10 for me. If they added extreme difficulty level with more challenge it would have been 10/10

And the Gameplay is a blast as well! Nothing better than zooming across the map and slicing baddies up, feeling like a god~ 
You can customize your version of V however you want, being able to change your mind almost at any point! And due to that, the replayability is also very great in my opinion

I would highly recommend getting it with the Phantom Liberty DLC as (imo) it greatly enhances the base game with a unique area, awesome items and mini bosses and a gripping and devastating story . 
It's cliche to say that CDPR have redeemed themselves from the godawful launch but its true, this game is a phenomenal technical and literary triumph. My 160hrs breezed by with still more I could've done.
I also had the joy of playing this entirely on my Steam Deck where it definitely did not look as good as it could've on a PC it was still really beautiful (if you're willing to play with settings). The performance still suffers noticeably often. Mostly in Dogtown and in other highly dense areas. Saying this, with my settings I regularly got a stable 60fps. Loading could sometimes take a few minutes. However, all these trade-offs did not put me off the game at all for the sheer fact that I could play Cyberpunk 2077 on the train/bus/work/couch.

1091500,"Cyberpunk 2077 is an amazing game that fully delivers on its promise of an immersive, futuristic RPG experience. From its stunning open world to its engaging gameplay and memorable characters, everything comes together in a way that makes it one of the best games I’ve played.

World & Atmosphere – Night City is Incredible
The world is absolutely breathtaking. Night City feels alive, with insane attention to detail, neon-lit streets, and a dark, dystopian atmosphere that pulls you in completely. Exploring the world is pure joy, whether you’re driving through the city or sneaking through high-tech buildings.

Story & Characters – A Strong Narrative
The main story is fantastic, with plenty of twists, emotional moments, and tough decisions. V is a great protagonist, and their story is engaging from start to finish. Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves) adds a unique dynamic, and his interactions with V are a highlight of the game.

The side characters are well-written, with standout moments from Panam, Judy, River, and Rogue. Side quests don’t feel like filler—they add depth to the world and its inhabitants, making every interaction feel meaningful.

Gameplay – Fun and Engaging
The combat is excellent—gunplay feels great, hacking adds depth, and cyberware upgrades allow for tons of customization. Whether you prefer stealth, brute force, or a mix of both, the game lets you approach missions however you want.

Driving feels smooth, and exploring Night City never gets old. The RPG mechanics are well-done, with a good balance of progression, skill upgrades, and gear customization.

Final Thoughts – A Must-Play
Despite its rough launch, Cyberpunk 2077 has been polished into an excellent RPG. The world, story, and gameplay all come together to make an immersive and unforgettable experience. If you love open-world games with deep storytelling and exciting gameplay, this is definitely worth playing.

1091500,"Cyberpunk 2077 can be described the same way as Night City itself: glamorous and rotten to the core.

The city is detailed and gorgeous, but it's empty, acting only as a set dressing for missions. The missions themselves have strong moments, but the writing is sometimes atrocious. There are a lot of choices, but most of the time the world just does its thing (seriously, the game kept throwing Panam's crotch into my face no matter how much I tried to keep our relationship professional). There are interesting upgrades in the skill tree and cool weapons and tools to use, but after a short while, you become so powerful it doesn't matter what you use. Updates have fixed the worst technical issues, so now it's only as buggy as you would expect from other open world games.

There are more issues but I'm too lazy to write them down. I hope you get the idea. I was about to click the thumb down.

Then I went through the ""point of no return"" and after that took some time to think back on the journey.

I'll be honest. I really enjoyed the payoff. And looking back, I very much appreciate the attempt to improve on the burning pile that are open world games. Time will tell how I'll remember this game. Is it worth being annoyed for 60 hours before a grand finale and an occasion to look at the state of AAA games? Your mileage may vary. 

Considering the games I enjoy, I would be a hypocrite if I gave this game a thumb down.

Combat is fluid and fun. Cyber enhancements make the game novel, but can lead to being overpowered quickly if you put points in the right places.

I found myself choosing the story over random quests despite my penchant for playing most open world games like a easily distracted dog chasing butterflies.

As for actual criticims, the biggest gripe I have with the game is its missed potential. Even after the patches, anyone who's played the game once (even without keeping up with its development cycle) can tell it was meant for a lot more. The map can feel flat in some places despite being the most gorgeous open world I've seen in a video game, the latter half of the story has the vibe of ""OK let's get this shit over with already"", and any semblance of balance is immediately annihilated the second you discover [spoiler] Sandevistan + Any fucking sword that has stats directly correlating to Sandevistan [/spoiler], BUT this is an RPG, OP builds are expected and the game still offers a wide range of options that are more than viable.

But instead I got a story that made me think hard about the choices I had to make and how it would affect the relations of those around me.

And now with Mods, its total chaos. If you watched Edge Runners and hesitant to buy the game due to the initial response release, Don't worry. Its far from that and no one will disagree that this game has truly done a 180. This game for sure has sparked my deep interest into dystopian genre and I appreciate it for that.

1091500,"Game is good after all, but endings leaves a different opinion, mosty due community ""correct"" opinion

!Ending spoilers!

[spoiler] With DLC there are 5 endings, and by the community opinion (because game directly says, and it is DLC one) where V have a normal (probably the only one ending where V will have a long live), althought in few others V survives but only for 6 months. In my opinion, it is kinda bs, because V survives in 3/5 endings, because V dies if Johnny takes his/her body ending, and ending where you take help from corpo (because you have option to live 6 months or accept deal of selling your soul to corpo) [/spoiler]


[spoiler] So, IMO, V survives and have long live in every other ending because V gets rid of the Johhny relic, so it stops damaging V`s brains. Because 6 months are given ONLY if you accept corpo path due removing relic. And the worst ending of having long live is in DLC ending, due problems with artifical brain. But in every ending where Alt helps V, and Johhny leaves V alone, she/he survives. [/spoiler]

The combat is really awesome and fun, when the edgerunner perk kicks in you feel invincible! The sandevistan its at another level. The katanas and Fist are really fun, and the stealth too, there are a lot of ways of doing the same mission and that gives you a really nice feeling.

There are a few details that I would love to change about somethings and mechanic tho:

Non lethal does not make any difference in almost all of the main story and sidequests and its quite sad, it makes it pointless. also, when you put K.O. an npc, it doesnt recover or wake up, making it hard to know if they are alive or just unconscious 
Some missions doesn´t have alternatives like with Evelyn that she well, yk. And even thought you can complete sidequest in different ways, in the
Theres a point in the story where I personally felt like the devs just said something like ¨mmm lets go straight to the end¨, after you talk with hanako it feels rushed.

1091500,"Hard to give a review without spoiling anything...

It's basically a combination of GTA5 + Metal Gear Solid (the older one from PS2). What is unique to this game is the environment/city. It's incredibly well designed and full of details. Very impressive environment, can't stress this enough.

Lots of ways to develop your character, almost difficult to understand at times. It's definitely complicated and while it can be neat, it's almost too much. Also you can't max out every stat, so you should focus on certain things you want. My character ended up being good at everything and I may want to do it again to see if the game play is different.


Tons of weapons and fighting styles.

Story line and characters are really good for a game. I highly recommend buying both the main game and DLC Phantom Liberty if it's on sale. The DLC alone is substantial content-wise.

Kinda wished there wasn't so much emphasis on the clothing and customization since your character is 1st person anyways, rarely do you see yourself.

I'm running this with a RTX 4070ti Super and it looks great. Getting great frames with 5700x CPU. There are some times where the game crashes, usually during super fast paced engagements like driving cars fast through the streets.

For those that are wondering they HAVE fixed all the bugs and glitches that people reported on launch but if your game is ''flat-lining'' there will be a fix on YT it sometimes has to do with outdated mods and you have to view the integrity of your files which again is online.

1091500,"I recommend this because it's the only half decent scifi ""Skyrim"" game available.  And no, Starfield doesn't rate even to this level.  So, pros are straightforward - it's Skyrim but cyberpunk.  Now for the cons.

TONS of bugs even years later.  Mission to stealth kill a boss.  I get to the room, choose dialog option, it leads to combat.  Reload a save from outside the room and now the game refuses to offer the dialog option even though I was clean up to the save.  I distract the boss via a terminal, he walks over to it back to me.  I enter the room and he instantly rubber bands back to his original location - just flies backwards 20 feet - and then alerts and I fail the stealth part.

Even when the game works ""normally"" stealth playstyle is totally fucked.  People just randomly turn on a dime and it forces a save and play approach which kills the fun.

Very Hard mode makes most builds and playstyles completely untenable.  Actually here, you're best bet is stealth takedowns from behind with HEAVY use of savescumming.  Not fun.

But if you like the idea of a stealth playstyle, maybe you'll focus on snipers.  Guess what, the only one you can run stealth is underpowered and won't kill anything above normal in one shot.  So you'll actually do better ""sniping"" at long range with a silenced pistol than a sniper rifle.  Ludicrous.

If you try to stealth attack with a katana you'll just injure them and alert everyone.  But with your bare hands you instakill.  Again, totally absurd.

Tons of poor interface issues.  Like even on keyboard a lot of things bind to the same thing.  So you'll finish a Police Scanner encounter and you have to wait like 15 seconds for the text of a journal drop to be available via  a pop up.  You need to wait, and trigger it then, or it's a PITA to go through the Journal interface.  But then you got XP at the same time and that triggers your fixer calling you with some shit, which interferes.  Or you want to pick an item up but no matter where you hover the mouse you can't get it - but you can pick up this other thing 5 feet to the left.  Or the radio in your apartment and car that randomly reset every time you leave - as if some asshole keeps breaking into your apartment and turning it back on.  There's a drop attack you can do, but if you don't land it ""right"" it'll screw up and then everyone is alerted so it's pretty unusable.  You can use throwing knives but only one.  Then it magically reappears like you're the God of War.  If you have more knives you can't use those - you have to wait for ""magic knife"".

Like most recent games it has a hamfisted ""woke"" storyline shoved in in the form of a trans revenge murder side quest.  Still didn't spare CDPR from woke backlash anyway, but given their recent C-suite exec wide eye stare youtube preaching fealty it's only going to get worse in their future games.  At least it's not as bad as FC6 where someone gets murdered for the crime of misgendering.

All of the endings are total ass.  I get that it's a dystopian future but they really screw over the protagonist and, by extension, the friends that you choose to ultimately die for you, die for nothing.  Unless you read the spoilers to unlock the secret solo ending and even then you get a shit ending.  Or use the Phantom Liberty new ending option and.. yeah that's still super shitty but at least you don't get your friends killed.

The newly added sandevistan builds are cool but then you can't disable cameras with the deck which makes the soft requirement to stealth half the quests impossible.  So it's an end game build option and there is no end game.

The story is amazing and immersive, the game does not force you on a certain path and I feel like the game builds upon much of what makes the witcher 3, fallout 4 and even mass effect games fun. Resulting in an experience which I don't believe to be matched by anything else. Also the DLC is amazing.

That being said, there are things which could have been done better. 
- Inventory management and crafting system can take time getting used to.
- Many of the character builds which could be fun to play on are not obvious and trying them out requires commitment which can't be reversed.
- The open nature of the game means you are likely to miss out on logbooks, quests and alternative endings. All of which could help you understand the world better and get more out of the game.
- Cyberpunk is also at least somewhat more gpu intensive that it has to be due to poorly implemented TAA anti aliasing and upscaling.

1091500,"I bought this game back in December of 2022. I remember having a ""meh"" attitude towards the whole game. The intro as a NOMAD, fixing your current car at the time, trying to become a known legend in Night City, I was not drawn in immediately. Meeting Jackie for the first time and doing the shoot-out with him smuggling an iguana, that was as far as I gotten back then. For a little over two years I did not pick up this game. I saw memes and bugs online and it made me more disinterested as time went on.

A friend of mine recommended that I give Cyberpunk 2077 another shot after I told him I have beaten God of War. When I tell you that I am currently addicted to this game, words can not describe the euphoria I have experienced lately. I have not had this much fun since Red Dead Redemption 2 came out back in 2018. The story telling and atmosphere is up there with some of the best rpgs I have ever played.

It is not perfect, but since CD Projekt Red has teased possibly a few more updates, there is no complaint from me here. My entire play through so far, I have experienced one crash: it involved doing several quick hacks against enemies and exploding a vehicle beside me. There have been npc's on the streets of Night City that would float above the ground when sitting. I experienced a bug once where my car would just drive in loops around my character, impeding my chances of getting in. Of all the hours I have put in, those have been minor inconveniences compared to stuff I experienced in 2022.

It took me about two hours to reach Night City and that is where things started picking up. The more you play and explore, you find yourself having a better understanding on how to play and interact with the game: cyber ware, crafting, upgrading guns, receiving free cool cars through missions, exploring areas, and finding unique items or guns (SKIPPY). Following through the main story or doing a side missions are well written and captivating.

1091500,"Just finished my first ending after finishing all the gigs and most side jobs.

The game has a lot of moments where it's really good thought provoking and hype. But it's so rough around the edges mostly because of inconsistentcey with decision making and the consequences of being inconsistent. The couple endings I've seen so far end on the climax without enough of a real conclusion in my opinion. This isn't helped by the fact time spent with characters is too limited to become invested in any of them properly. All the side job and gig characters endings feel too abrupt and as if the team had to finish them to finish the product in time for a deadline instead of tell a full story. Also dialogue is stiff and sound just kinda dumb in some scenes.  Except Johnny because he's with you the whole game and does develop and change over time with V depending on how you act which is what I would have liked more from other characters. Johnny's character, development and conclusion is by far my favourite part of the game.

Unfortunately the whole game feels like it's just better to wait for the sequel which will improve upon all the many minor issues with this game which hold it back from being one of the greats. Especially as it's still littered with major bugs even on the 2.2 patch. The games main strengths are it's immersive, atmospheric and is backed by an awesome fitting soundtrack but it most importantly is very fun (especially the combat) so it's still worth playing for sure if you're interested.

1091500,"I played the Cyberpunk 2077 PS4 day one release version, by many considered to be the worst version of the game. About 2/3rds of the way through the slog I gave up. The game just wasn't worth playing, and I was hardly the only one who felt this way. Many updates later it finally reached a state where many people have now come around to it. Though the game is far more enjoyable then it was on release and I would recommend it, I personally feel like it still has some fundamental issues that run deeper than bugs and combat.

2077 only superficially resembles the original TTRPG. While elements like slang give dialog a great level of authenticity, many core pillars of Cyberpunk are absent from this digital version of Night City. While I'm sad to see fun elements like Posergangs (gangs who get plastic surgery to look like celebrities) go, I believe that there are two core features that are instrumental to the ""Cyberpunk experience"" that 2077 is lacking:

[h2] 1. Role Playing [/h2]
Cyberpunk is first and foremost a Role Playing Game. Night City is merely a thematic backdrop for characters created by passionate players to explore choices, themes, and stories. 2077's protagonist, V, is a supremely written character but that is exactly the issue. V is a pre-written character like Geralt in the Witcher, and is fundamentally closer to Fallout 4's Nate/Nora than any TTRPG player character. Though V is given depth in writing, the player is given no depth of choice. Nowhere is this clearer than in the player's interactions with the character of Johnny Silverhand. If the player blindly aligns themselves with Silverhand's ideals or completely opposes them, his character makes sense. However, if the player handles Johnny's many remarks with the nuance they deserve his character quickly becomes confusing. Nuance makes Johnny come off as a try-hard contrarian, someone who bases their entire personality on always being different; both from other people and from other's expectations. This feels like incredible character depth... until you realize the game doesn't allow you to acknowledge it in any way. This wasn't masterful writing, it's an accident. It's the game's limited reactivity laid bare. Johnny isn't someone who hides his real feeling away behind layers upon layers of irony, sarcasm, and contrarianism, he's just a complete and utter jackass (read: hero) who keeps talking about his cock every chance he gets. The only real question the game poses on Johnny, the second most important character in this story-driven ""RPG"", is whether you think his actions were justified. The entire game is like this. Simple binary choices. Sometimes you get to use your skills in dialog for some extra money or to bypass a combat section, but rarely do you get to define who V is as a character because that has already been determined for you.

[h2] 2. HumanityPunk [/h2]
Humanity is a core theme in Cyberpunk to the point it even has an associated stat. In the TTRPG it is directly related to your character's empathy. Installing cyberware (bionic implants) risks insanity, and only highly empathetic characters can reap the benefits of multiple cybernetic enhancements without losing their humanity. This core concept is completely absent from V as a character. NPCs get a handful of military implants and go psycho but V can replace their entire body with machine parts and suffer no consequences. The reason humanity is so important to Cyberpunk's identity is because it's dystopian trans-humanist setting is all about stories centered on humanity's continued perseverance. It's about human emotion, tragedy, relationships, fighting for your beliefs, burning out rather than fading away. It's punk. Nowhere is this more clear than in the game's anime series, Cyberpunk: Edgerunner. It is no accident that Edgerunners completely revitalized interest in the game. It embodies all the great thematic qualities inherent to Cyberpunk-- qualities that 2077 only flirts with. Humanity as it is understood in the TTRPG is at the forefront of the series, and it makes for one of the most exciting, unique, and heart wrenching anime of the past decade. This quality is a double-edged sword; it exposed how lacking 2077 was in comparison. The game feels directionless, meandering. It only hints at themes instead of going all out. It has well-written characters, but they are just there to make up for the human struggles that V lacks. None of it is punk, it's just cyber.

Despite my criticisms I do feel Cyberpunk 2077 is a game worth playing. The combat system is vastly improved over the original release and now allows for ~3 core playstyles. The gunplay itself is so-so, but everything surrounding it like movement, special abilties, hacks, and slow motion make it engaging. Stats and the skill tree now actually feel meaningful, though this is largely limited to combat. The characters that you interact with are authentically written and acted, even if they aren't very punk. I like that they left some room in Night City for more human experiences. An example of this would be how a side character runs a new age spiritualism shop and will read you tarot. That seems out of place in a cybernetic future, but that's exactly what makes it feel authentic and human. What I especially like is that V's romance options are gender-specific but that the game still lets you embarrass yourself by flirting with someone who is not interested. Characters feel more real when they aren't just prizes to be won as part of the player's wish fulfillment.

At the end of the day Cyberpunk 2077 is a semi-competent open world action game in a setting loosely inspired by the Cyberpunk TTRPG. It lacks choices and thematic depth/consistency, but generally creates an engaging experience through combat gameplay and writing. If you like slightly generic open world games that constantly drip-feed you dopamine by having you travel towards a marker and then shooting a couple guys there, this game is for you. 

[h3] ""The game isn't punk, and that's the most punk thing about it."" [/h3]

[b] nit-picky rant bit [/b]
Here's some smaller things that shouldn't really matter but they annoyed me so now I'm gonna annoy you:
- In-game radio is godawful. I know CDPR commissioned a bunch of songs for the game. I think they should get their money back. Still cry everytime ""I wanna stay at your house"" comes on though.
- Cameos. I like Kojima and his classic Kojimbo rambling and thought Jesse Cox did a great job voicing his character. That said, Grimes' delivery was so impressively bad that I can still feel the second-hand embarrassment. But hey, at least she's consistent in her talent.
- CDPR spent so much time developing all these gangs and their identities only to use them as disposable fodder.
- There's technically a lot of clothing but most of it is reskins of the same few items. There's way more pieces of clothing in the game than what you can get but CDPR doesn't want us to be drippy so all we got is this mediocre wardrobe.
- City feels kinda artificial (in a bad way). Witcher 3's towns all felt pretty lively but in 2077 I often find myself thinking about how unnatural things look and feel.
- Couldn't romance Aurore Cassel from the DLC. I know I previously said wish fulfillment is bad but in this specific case I retract that statement because it suits me.
- Tiered loot is lazy and mostly based on the level you are.
- Can't change the skin on a gun, which is silly. Also don't know what skin an attachment has until you equip it.
- Speaking of skins, the game has a feature where you can copy a car's skin, but this only works on very specific vehicles for arbitrary reasons.
- There's ripperdocs other than Viktor (he's my ride or die)
- This entire section was honestly just an excuse to talk about the Grimes thing, I'm still surprised that made it into the game.
- Cars in a game like this don't need realistic physics simulations, just make them fun to drive.",True,True,"played Cyberpunk 2077 PS4 day one release version , many considered worst version game . 2/3rds way slog gave . game n't worth playing , hardly one felt way .

1091500,"Wow. Just wow.

I've put in around 300 hours into this game 50/50 split here and on console. I've experience 3 of the 6 different endings, and of the 3 I've seen, they are so worth it. Cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece through-n-through. I'll break it up into sections, and I promise not to spoil anything that's not in the trailers or stuff like that, but this game has been out for so long and has had its' fair share of press over the years.

V: I have never been so immersed into a character....ever. V truly is whoever you want them to be. Their origin, their journey, their finale. I played Male V first, then Female V. Both are done to perfection. They have little differences that change everything about them, yet they are the same character. Male V is just sick of everyone's BS all the time, and Female V has this sound of hopeful spirit in her voice. It's fair to say you'll spend a lot time with V and you will have a preference. I mean to say that they are not identical in their mannerisms, tones and if you ever see comparison videos of the two in cut scenes, you'll tell! I have to give a massive shout out to Gavin Drea (Male V) and Cherami Leigh (Female V) as well as CDPR. You killed it! Especially with lockdown and Gavin recording in London and Cherami in Los Angeles. You will love V, no matter what. Trust me.

Never Fade Away: The story is superb! Again, no spoilers. You all know that Keanu Reeves makes a appearance in this game and my god...I'll get to him next. Story is so rich and full of meaningful characters -and I mean besides the occasional 20 min side mission - everyone stands out. The game is split into 3 acts all of which have very identifiable characteristics. I wont get into the nitty gritty but I will say that the pacing is great! Unless you are 100%ing it then it takes forever but that's my doing. You will cry, you will laugh, you will cringe and you will have one helleva time. 

Wake the F*** up, Samurai: Keanu f****** Reeves. Easily steals the show whenever he is there and trust me, he's there! He plays a rocker boy called Johnny Silverhand and...yeah, breathtaking. So stellar and by the later half of this run I would skip most dialogue unless it was him. He's like Jack Sparrow meets Gordon Ramsey. Johnny and V mesh perfectly together and truly form a symbiotic relationship together. Not in a weird way but a kickass way. For male V he is like the most loyal brother you could wish for and for Female V is like the annoying younger brother who has some valuable pointers but she just wants to go by her day. 

The City of Dreams: There is no better world design than Night City. None. It is so goddamn gorgeous. If you can run it with raytracing it's 1000 times better. The neon lights and truly ""bladerunner"" vibes never gets old. I've caught myself wasting hours just driving around the city at night looking at the massive ads everywhere illuminating the night sky. Truly unbelievable. The outskirts of Night City feel like outskirts in all the right ways as it's integral to one (or two) of the many story lines. It's not bland with nothing to do, though Night City is so addicting. All the areas have such distinct characteristics and you will always know where you are just by the environment. The world (though they promised more) is still crazy. The people you meet become so connected to Night City and it's many districts that you'll see them as one in the same thing. I can't say enough about this and how incredible a job they did by making a truly believable city with our societal, economic and political ways. 

PHANTOM LIBERTY: This is the DLC for the game (again no spoilers except one) and it can provide an alternate ending for V. You meet more memorable people and another celebrity (Idris Elba), face more strong narrative choices and it truly bumps the game's experience up a notch. When I played the game on Xbox, obviously this wasn't made yet and I loved the game. But when this came out, it brought a massive update known as 2.0. Which literally turned this game into Cyberpunk 2077 2.0. The progression, the customisation, the upgrades, the games performance....it became what it was set out to be back in 2020. All of this stuff is free to everyone besides the DLC section but yeah damn, Phantom Liberty is so worth it as it (Like CDPR's Witcher 3) is long. It added about 25 more hours to the game as my latest run was at 70 hrs. Waiting for a sale is never a bad idea but if you can buy it at full price, do it. You will not regret it. 

For 100%ing: Oh boy, this game took me...well you can see. Over 100hrs to beat. It wasn't hard but it was a grind. I chose to do all the side missions and Phantom Liberty as soon as they popped up which made the game run so damn long lol. It was worth it to me as I love this game. It does have 2-3 achievements that aren't tied to just playing the game. What I mean is like ""throw a grenade, hack someone and do this blah blah blah all at once"" which you would never do naturally. Look up the achievements once you've finished the game as they are easy to miss. 

You're Breathtaking!: Overall this is worth every penny and is truly a monumental story. The game had major problems at the start, as you may all know. But I believed in this games success and I am so happy that it worked out. This is the No Mans Sky of single player games. Truly a remarkable recovery and a breathtaking experience. One last thing about this game. It's a warning. That is it's biggest strength. If we don't change our ways, we will have Night City (Night City is Los Angeles, FYI). The corruption, the complete economic disarray. The whole kit and caboodle. It's actually polarising, and yet shockingly familiar to our world. Just something I've found interesting. I know I wrote a thesis on this lol but to me this game deserves it.

1091500,"Playing Cyberpunk 2077 over four years after release is a completely different experience than when it launched. The myriads of game breaking bugs and underbaked or entirely non-existent promised features have all been resolved, and now it has become one of the most visually immersive and detailed video games on the market.

Nothing quite compares to Night City; it is truly the games’ strongest aspect as you will find yourself constantly drawn into the unique aesthetic and vibe of the city. Playing with path tracing elevates this to the next level, as it completely transforms the game. When it comes to graphics, Cyberpunk is best in class.

The main story is pretty good. The characters you meet mostly have a personality and the story kept me interested the whole way through. Combat was also good, with great variety in weapon type and satisfying feedback. Vehicles and driving were also another highlight, with a wide variety of cars that were easily obtainable and all being fun to drive. The soundtrack is also excellent.

The game is far from perfect though. The biggest issue I have is the illusion of choice the game has. The choices you make prior to the point of no return have virtually no impact on the ending you receive, or the outcome of certain quests. The game draws you in with ‘unique’ life-paths (nomad, corpo, street kid), but these offer nothing but random dialogue options that exist as nothing but flavour text. Its particularly disappointing because it is advertised as a defining choice that will shape your playthrough, which it simply does not.

I also found the game incredibly easy. I was disappointed that there wasn’t much of a challenge that forced me to optimise my build to tackle certain missions or bosses. It felt like a waste of such a unique combat system.

Some side quests are also incredibly dull, and the sheer amount of them combined with the various gigs and simple combat missions scattered throughout the city felt as if they were simply a means to increase the games length.

Crafting is also completely meaningless, and the skill trees are vast and complex, yet mild in their actual impact – but these are only minor gripes.

What resolves all the above is the Phantom Liberty DLC. It is hands down the best DLC I have ever played in a game. The narrative and characters are immersive and engaging, and the environment of Dogtown is stunning. It is truly the summation of the strongest aspects of Cyberpunk. Unfortunately, this elevation from the base game in almost every aspect works against itself as the DLC (which is played out roughly half-way through the game) feels tonally different and almost out of place because of how good it is. 

Overall, Cyberpunk 2077 is excellent. Playing for the first time in 2025 feels exactly like the Cyberpunk that was originally promised all those years ago. It has been refined over the years and is finally in a place that cements it as one of the action RPG greats.

It's been a while since I jump into a lore rabbit-hole like this game has.

In my opinion, this game could expand more of it's features so that some of them wouldn't feel half-baked and/or put there just for the sake of it.

1091500,"Cyberpunk 2077 has been a fun experience so far, but I’ve lost count of how many times it has crashed on me. There have been moments where I genuinely thought a bug was part of a mission—only to log in the next day and realize, nope, it was just a glitch. The story itself is great, but the constant crashing and bugs make it overwhelming at times.

I had someone tell me they didn’t like GTA V, but honestly, Cyberpunk 2077 feels like the same kind of game, just set in a different time period.

The game is definitely enjoyable, despite its flaws.

That said, one thing that bugs me (besides the literal bugs) is how sexuality is integrated into the game. I mean, throwing in a random dildo or some nudity? Whatever, that’s not a big deal.

1091500,"Ignoring launch, it is a beautiful game set in the most immersive city I've ever played. I beat it on console and played a little bit of the new updates, so I'll give my opinion. Very, very good story. Even a little unnervingly prophetic. A future we can avoid, but not one devoid of hope, just very full of the worst of humanity. Every character is well done and polished. Every build has a decently fun gameplay loop that differs in certain key ways. I think my only problem with the game is that it is actively killing my system while I try to play it on certain settings, like it's definitely pretty bad when nearly five years after release people are still using your game as the benchmark. And don't get me wrong, the game is absolutely pushing the limits of graphical fidelity and is a testament to how far we've come, but lord this game needs a data center to run well enough. And they aren't even using the REDEngine for their next project, so it's like all that to just switch over to Unreal Engine? Come on man.

Don't know if this is nearly the same CD Projekt Red as the one that made The Witcher III these days, but for what it's worth, this game ended up alright.

1091500,"Cyberpunk 2077 might very well be the worst release of a AAA video game in my lived experience. I spent a great deal of time since 2020 looking at CDPR's latest Open-World RPG as indicative of its loss of moral fiber and integrity; and its endless desire for Capital as a now-publically-traded company. 

It wasn't until Fall of 2024 that my older brother spoke out about his love for this title, and I decided to return to it on sale for $30.


I have an endless list of complaints for this game. I feel that CDPR has made a great deal of sacrifices in making this an open-world experience instead of a more tailor-made, linear game. In general, I find that open-world video games fail to meet my meagre expectations, and Cyberpunk 2077 is no exception on this front. The world is very static and unreactive, the consequences and choices to be made outside of quests are so negligible they will never impact your gameplay. The side-quest content in Cyperpunk 2077 is awful; and by and large it only exists to grant resources for those interested in grinding. The RPG-progression system is terrible, and its reworks have done very little to improve upon its initial, unplayable state.

Despite all of these complaints, the main storyline and quests of Cyberpunk 2077 are incredibly memorable, impactful, and thought-provoking. If this game existed only as the series of Main Quests provided, it would be a generally better experience. And despite the sacrifices made to make this game Open-World, the parts that survived are absolutely worth your time. Without any desire to spoil the experience, I recommend Cyberpunk 2077 for the sale price of 30$, and believe you will have a great time playing it for that price. I do not recommend this title at 60$, but it has a long history of deep discounts--try and buy it during the Summer or Winter Sales.

1091500,"Cyberpunk 2077 has evolved into one of the most immersive and exhilarating experiences in modern gaming. With the release of Phantom Liberty, CD Projekt Red has not only solidified its reputation but also raised the bar for open-world RPGs. From its deep narrative to its mind-blowing visuals, here’s a rundown of everything cool you can do in the world of Cyberpunk 2077 and the Phantom Liberty expansion.

A World Like No Other-
Night City is alive in a way that few game worlds can rival. The neon-lit streets pulse with energy, full of dangerous alleys, upscale penthouses, and everything in between. Whether you're speeding down a highway on a motorcycle, walking through crowded marketplaces, or simply soaking in the stunning architecture, the world feels real. The addition of Phantom Liberty expands this world even further, introducing the new area of Dogtown—a lawless district with a gritty, dystopian vibe that’s as dangerous as it is fascinating.

Incredible Character Customization-
In Cyberpunk 2077, you create a character that’s uniquely yours. The customization options are vast, from your appearance to your cybernetic enhancements, which not only look cool but also impact gameplay. You can become a smooth-talking Netrunner hacking into systems, a deadly solo mercenary tearing through enemies, or a techie creating gadgets that make you a force to be reckoned with. The Phantom Liberty DLC adds even more layers to the gameplay, with new abilities and cyberware that further shape your playstyle.

Epic Storytelling & Choices-
The heart of Cyberpunk 2077 is its narrative. With Phantom Liberty, you’re thrust into a thrilling spy-like plot, working with (or against) the mysterious Solomon Reed and navigating through a world of high stakes and shady alliances. Every decision you make shapes the outcome, from the characters you help to the factions you align with. The voice acting is top-tier, and the complex relationships you form with allies, enemies, and even the city itself, are some of the best in RPGs.

Combat and Action-
Combat in Cyberpunk 2077 feels fluid and intense, whether you’re using traditional guns, futuristic tech, or your fists. The new weapons in Phantom Liberty, like the ""Liberty"" pistol, are a blast to use, and the expanded skill trees let you refine your approach. You can stealth your way through missions, hacking cameras and security systems to avoid detection, or you can go in guns blazing, engaging in fast-paced shootouts with deadly enemies. The level of freedom you have in combat, combined with the variety of weapons and gadgets at your disposal, makes every encounter feel fresh.

Vehicles and Exploration-
Night City isn’t just a place to fight—it’s a place to explore. The game offers a huge array of vehicles, from sleek sports cars to brutal motorcycles. You can race through the streets at lightning speed, or simply cruise along the coastlines of the Pacifica district, enjoying the breathtaking views. Phantom Liberty introduces new vehicles to the mix, including some with special modifications that can help you evade enemies or tackle tough missions.

Cyberware and Augmentations-
One of the coolest aspects of Cyberpunk 2077 is the cyberware system. You can install all sorts of upgrades, from neural processors that enhance your ability to hack, to robotic limbs that make you a wrecking machine in combat. The Phantom Liberty DLC adds even more enhancements, such as advanced implants that allow you to hack into enemy systems, manipulate the battlefield, and gain the upper hand in ways you’ve never seen before.

The Music and Atmosphere-
Cyberpunk 2077 would be nowhere near as amazing without its atmospheric soundtrack, which pulls you deep into the cyberpunk vibe. The score, mixed with the pulse of techno, industrial, and synthwave, keeps you hyped as you tear through Night City. The addition of new music in Phantom Liberty only amplifies the sense of being in a futuristic, dystopian world where danger is always just around the corner.

Engaging Side Content-
Beyond the main story, there’s a wealth of side content that ensures you’ll never run out of things to do. From fixing up cars, to engaging in dangerous gigs for shady clients, to participating in street races, Cyberpunk 2077 makes sure you’re always immersed in something exciting. Phantom Liberty brings new activities and factions that expand the lore even more, making every corner of the world feel rich with possibilities.

Graphics and Visuals-
Simply put, the visuals are breathtaking. The city is a living, breathing entity, with day-night cycles, weather changes, and stunning environmental details. The graphical improvements from the base game to the Phantom Liberty expansion are also evident, with even more attention to detail in textures, lighting, and character models. From neon signs reflecting off wet pavement to the awe-inspiring vistas of the outskirts of the city, it’s a visual feast that’s hard to look away from.

Phantom Liberty: A Must-Play DLC-
Phantom Liberty takes Cyberpunk 2077 to the next level. It introduces an entirely new narrative filled with twists and turns, alongside brand-new characters, missions, and challenges. The expansion focuses on espionage, political intrigue, and a shadowy world that feels even more dangerous and exciting than before. The new location, Dogtown, is a fresh playground that’s perfect for anyone who loves the chaos of the Cyberpunk world. The stakes are higher, and the action is even more intense.

1091500,"The Cyberpunk story is very engaging, and I would recommend playing it while also completing all the side quests, as they add more depth to the overall experience. Gameplay-wise, it’s great, but some builds are definitely better than others. That being said, I don’t fully understand the lock system that only allows you to reset your build a couple of times. For me, it doesn’t make much sense, as the more you play, the better you get at recognizing the build you want to stick with, or you might just want to try something different.

Driving in the game is a bit lackluster; most cars handle poorly, with the exception of the more sporty ones, which drive much better. Since I played way after launch, the only bugs I encountered were minor visual glitches or some NPCs acting weird, but nothing that would break the game.

The graphics are probably some of the best out there, and with new technologies like DLSS and AMD FSR, you can probably run the game on a mid-range PC configuration. Just keep in mind that ray tracing and path tracing are very demanding and are not essential for great visuals. You’ll still enjoy the game without them.

1091500,"Played the full game, plus DLC, and almost all endings. - starting from the Streets.
If you heard things about this game having issues, know that in my experience, there are very few bugs and they were just funny, it is very polished, and very much feels like a finished game.

This game is one of my favourites. It looks stunning, the combat I chose was a ninja, which was fast and fluid (if not a bit OP), focusing on Speed, Stealth and Blade abilities. I could become invisible, slow down time, then jump and slash large groups of enemies rapidly before they knew what hit them.

The story was decent, but with how many missions there are and how broken up it is, it is easy to forget what the last thing that happened was. It is possible to play through a path of missions without breaking them up, but it isn't natural because they often require a passage of time between them, which can only be skipped by going to an apartment to sleep that time away.

I definately recommend this game to people, but know that this isn't a game with many choices like I thought it was going to be. Saying no to a mission just means that mission will be sitting waiting for you to change your mind. Almost all decisions of importance are at the end. It is a lot like most AAA games, but it has some brilliant characters and blade combat that made every moment worthwhile.

[spoiler] One story and set of characters did really stand out for me though - Judy and Evelyn. The writing and voice acting was sublime, I really cared about Evelyn and was heartbroken by her story. But Judy is so perfectly my type it threw me, I've never experienced a connection like that in a game, it was very interesting! I worked so hard to get an ending where she would be with me, and nearly thought I had made a mistake, then I saw her waiting and I was so happy! Thank you for providing me with a nice send-off.

Night City is a world of it's own filled with struggling families, psychotic gangs and corporations that want to bleed you drier than the Saharan desert, but there are also people who wan't the world to change, and they're willing to act for it too if they can just get a little push from a friendly merc along the way.

After completing the game the first time I felt a bit melancholic but also hopeful for V's future, Then i played through the other endings and felt sad, this was not because the endings were written badly but rather because in Night City you're lucky to even live to see another day.

1091500,"Really beautiful game— visually, thematically, narratively, and technically. It's extremely polished now, and feels amazing to play. The sheer scope of this game's world and the amount of (usually dangerous) nooks & crannies V can get lost in can sometimes be overwhelming, but it's absolutely worth it to take the time and really explore the map rather than just drive from place to place never really taking anything in. The combat system has surprising depth! I was particularly impressed by the stealth mechanics, but there are so many different approaches you can take. It's just so satisfying experiencing the progression of a build and feeling V becoming more and more of a terrifying presence with each gig. The story and characters though are where this game really shines. V's desperate struggle to survive in such a hostile, bleak world is a deeply profound and relatable one. The more you experience it, the more you will begin to understand why the people that V encounters, even the filthiest scumbags and bastards, operate in the way that they do. And yes, Phantom Liberty is an extraordinary expansion that REALLY explores this dynamic and tests both you and V's limits in regards to it, making it a definitive part of the Cyberpunk 2077 experience.

Night City is a monster that wants to eat both you and V alive, but you'll both find reasons to stick around no matter what. For me, it was the thrilling combat, the provocative storytelling, and the cast of characters of varying degrees of moral bankruptcy. One of my new favorite games of all time.

1091500,"I didn't play this game on launch, so this is an unbiased review about how the game is now.

Insane amount of content in this game. This is a polished, high-end RPG. It's not particularly choice-driven in the dialogue, but it's a joy to immerse yourself in.

The cyberware is cool but I would have loved them to go further. The power fantasy feels stifled. I have fortified ankles and can do super jumps and tank rockets to the face, but I die if I fall more than about ten metres - that takes me out of the experience every time. Moving into the next game I would love for them to go further in the power fantasy and cyberware aspect. Let me leap higher, run faster, pick up and throw cars at the very high end of things - the kind of things you'd see in Edgerunners, or Prototype. 

The story is great and I think threads a pretty great line between the story it's trying to tell, and the choices the player is allowed to make. This is definitely more of a linear story that you can affect, but when you have characters like Johnny Silverhand so deeply involved in your own story, it's really carried. The NPCs and their believable personalities really make the game.

It's lucky that the missions are such high quality and that there are so many of them, because the sandbox part of the game is actually pretty barebones. I mean, the city is spectacular and hugely detailed, but street-level NPCs aren't really driven by much. There aren't really any systems that allow for any kind of emergent gameplay. You have the GTA stars system, you can fight MaxTac, that's pretty cool. You can buy cars, steal cars ... that's about it. You can't rob stores, there aren't really any 'activities' out in the world that aren't tied directly to missions. Crafting is there, and it does its job without becoming tedious, which I appreciate.

I will say that of the missions, there is a nice mix between longer involved missions, and shorter tasks like eliminating cyberpsychos or responding to NCPD crimes. The generous amount of the latter really makes up for the lack of other open world content. The story missions are great but some of them take actual hours to complete, and it'd be great if there were more of a heads up about which missions those were. Phantom Liberty teases a new area, but doesn't tell you that the introductory mission is about 4 hours of linear content during which time you're locked in. Would be great if I knew what I was getting into.

CDPR clearly focused more on the bespoke content, and since there's so much of it, I can't fault them at all. Next game I would love to see more systems-driven and emergent stuff, and better cyberware ... but if the game is simply more of the same, I'll still be happy.",True,True,"n't play game launch , unbiased review game .

Probably one of my favorite games of all time, great characters, amazing DLC, and a very good story. The amount of critical decision making in this game makes it feel genuine and does what a ton of roleplay games fail at (IM TALKING ABOUT YOU FALLOUT 4.) which is making the player actually like the characters, nothing in this game feels empty when it comes to the characters, I found myself really enjoying character dialog with nearly every character in the game, I felt like the choices I made actually mattered, like they had actual impact. And not only that, but the use of a protagonist that is essentially a blank-slate allows for a plethora of head-cannons and playstyles.

Overall Cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece, and what all roleplaying games should strive to be.

1091500,"I cannot say this enough - this is the single best gaming experience I have ever had. Without spoiling anything, let me just say this; this game feels lonely. Lonely in the sense that you are in a sea of people, and you do not matter. And you are saying this as one of the most powerful, influential mercs in Night City. You can only imagine how the average person in NC feels. And it's entirely immersive - the city waits for nobody, especially not a corporate hellscape like Night City. You either keep up, or you're swallowed up by the tide. Throughout the game, you are consistently reminded of that by the worldbuilding.

I don't have much else to say, this is just one of those games that you just HAVE to experience yourself; one review, or even a thousand reviews isn't going to cut it. The voice acting is among the best I've seen in any game; so much so that a friend of mine thought that I was watching an anime. Graphics are a no-brainer; among the best as well, and after many years, finally optimized.

1091500,"Years after its release and with continued support from CD Projekt Red, Cyberpunk 2077 remains a combination of impressive and deeply disappointing.

We were promised something more, and we had reason to believe CDP could deliver it. In-depth hacking, the freedom to play as any type of character, the ability to mold your own career as a runner to suit your play style and story taste. The truth is that even with 100+ mods made by a dedicated community, it still doesn't live up to what CDP made us expect.

It's still a great game. It has an engaging story, first of all. And some parts of the story can have radically different outcomes based on how you choose to deal with dialogue and how you complete the jobs. But the promise of emergent storytelling in the open world is not lived up to. Sure, there are a lot of cool details to be found around the world, conversations you can eavesdrop on, etc. But there is a huge missed opportunity of giving more personality to the gangs, involving yourself in their politics, having factions fighting each other (in other than scripted events), having reputation systems with various factions and fixers, and so on. Instead you get ""Street cred"", a single stat that unlocks basically everything, and that you can max really quickly because everything you do awards it and you can't lose it.

My recommendation for playing this game unmodded is to focus on the main story. Even the Very Hard difficulty will quickly become ridiculously easy (possibly with the exception of a few annoying scripted sequences) if you pick good perks and cyberware, so don't expect a tactical challenge.

The other option is to start modding, and if you've been there before, you know what kind of headaches you're going to have if you want to get it right. You can fix the main glaring flaws fairly quickly using NexusMods and their mod organiser Vortex, but if you want to start combining mods more carefully, the safest way is still manually installing them, which is a pain. Particularly because Steam's ridiculous policy to force you to update your games (well, the games they are kind enough to let you borrow), meaning you can't roll back to a functioning game version. (And this is why I am going to move to GOG for any games they have in the future.)

I enjoy the hell out of the story, and with the right mods Cyberpunk can become a shadow of what we dared to hope for when we listened to CDPR promote it all those years ago.

1091500,"its fun. I liked playing it. The characters are well written and the environment is well designed. Its very good at making you feel cool and bad-ass. Gunplay feels really good, same with melee combat, not really driving, I think driving feels really bad. The actual story is mediocre and its creativity is kind of bad. There are a lot of cool concepts the game talks about but then kind of drops past the ""main story"" (braindances.), cyberware is kind of boring and so are the people who wear them, kind of like the cyberware in the TTRPG. Cyberware is really interesting (for me) because it allows people to look less human either for aesthetic or utilitarian purposes and it creates conversations about it, a lot of the people you see who have cyberware just look like normal people with metal, even some of maelstroms members are just normal guys with metal limbs and their whole thing is being modified beyond humanity. The game doesnt really offer you any philosophical concepts to think about outside of stuff like ""is killing people y/n"" or ""burn bright or stay dim"" (which it drops after the first act). Idk I think RED dropped the ball on a lot of the ""non-game"" aspects of this, its more punk (rebelling for the sake of rebelling) than cyber and the TTRPG shipped alongside this is kind of bad too. Its a good game though. I'm sure project Orion will be better.

1091500,"Cyberpunk has come a long way since launch.  I pre ordered it and then cancelled when I saw all of the bugs and instability that it had in 2020.  Coming back to it and getting all the achievements I had a great time playing through the main story and phantom liberty.  I became attached to some of the characters and found the whole experience to be quite immersive at times.  The unique combat abilities and vast amounts of weaponry really make killing enemies fun and engaging!  You have many different builds to choose from to fit your playstyle.  I will not spoil anything but I will say that you are in for many surprises at the end game.    On the flipside I did encounter some bugs that softlocked me at times and found myself at 60-70 frames in crowded areas on medium settings with a 3090 card.  All in all I definitely recommend this game if you are looking for a decent story and a ton of gameplay.  You have tons to do when you beat the game as well.  You definitely get your moneys worth!  Cheers to project red for listening to the community and for putting in the effort to make the game enjoyable and playable.  Overall I rate cyberpunk at 4/5!

",True,True,"good story telling , bugs still playable"
1091500,"Probably one of the few games that is open exploration that I enjoy immensely.

The story of the main questlines are okay, a few of them are extremely gimmicky but I'd much rather just go in guns blazing for sake of the fact its quicker and easier than just having to stealth around all the bloody time.

I mostly just enjoy doing the side quests, bumping into random events, and doing the NCPD assaults. It is simply insane just how much money and experience you can get doing that--and by the time I finished only two districts in Night City, I was already max Street Cred.

The game has a strong emphasis on 'play how you want to play' and doesn't really punish you that heavily.

Yes, the game has a Wanted system that functions almost identically to the one in GTA V but its actually leagues above and beyond in terms of quality compared to that one. How?

Let's observe how it functions in GTA V first--In GTA V when you get wanted levels, cops instantly know where you are and home in on you like missiles, they will actively hunt you down and even go into side alleys, above and below ground level, and will even use flying copters to track you down until the cops find you and kill you. The likelihood of getting away from the Cops in GTA V is very minimal unless you have every street memorized or having hiding spots planned ahead of time.

In Cyberpunk 2077, the Cops are lazy. If you literally just stay away from the roads, hide behind buildings or on rooftops or stay underground; the cops will literally get bored of trying to find you and go do something else. The Cops in this game, as well--also unlike in GTA V--are extremely weak. You can blaze through most NCPD units without much effort. Then they send in armored units which can be a bit tougher, but are manageable. But if you are truly determined to turn Night City into a Warzone you will have to contend with something that puts even the Military in GTA V to utter shame--MaxTac.

MaxTac are essentially mini-bosses that come in squadrons of 4 after you reach 5 Wanted stars and continue to become a pain in the city's butt. Depending on your own level, the difficulty, your gear and your setup you can either mow them down easily (keep in mind they are literal bloody hit point sinks) or they will blow you away within seconds. But if you manage to kill them, you do get a rare chance of obtaining some of their MaxTac gear, from what I understand.

All in all, this game by CDProjektRed is probably one of my most enjoyed experiences in the entirety of my time playing any computer game and even when I play the game overly-much and burn myself out and come back later? I can get right back into the groove of things because of one of THE best character systems I have EVER seen in a video game.

The Character Attributes and Perks system.

In this game, you have attributes which help you do most any kind of thing. Same with Perks, with assist with all manner of thing--both combat and non-combat.

Want to be a Bulldozer and just plow through everything with nothing but a baseball bat, and being so armored that nothing can take you down? Check.

Want to be that stealthy cyberninja that is able to throw daggers that can instantly down unalerted enemies, or use a silenced pistol in order to blow off the head of some gangster? Check.

Want to be the most powerful cyberhacker (netrunner) who is capable of detonating the car of a bunch of gangsters chasing after you? Check.

And that's not all--you are able to completely refund EVERY attribute and perk, for free, in order to try out a DIFFERENT build later so there is NO way to screw up your game by having invested into the wrong, crappy build.

I rarely feel this way about games lately, but to me? This game gets a bloody 10 out of 10. Perfect in every bloody way. THIS IS HOW YOU DESIGN A GOOD GAME, TRIPLE A PUBLISHERS AND DEVELOPERS.

1091500," 	Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the last few years you know how chaotic the release for this game was. Now I can confidently say that all that’s in the past. My first playthrough a few months after release had me underwhelmed and I just stopped midway through the game. But I recently played the Witcher 3 and enjoyed it enough so that I wanted to give Cyberpunk a second chance, and boy was I in for a good trip ! Most if not all bugs have been fixed, the balance and overall systems have been redone for the best and now the game is a real treat to play. 
 	Much like the Witcher 3’s Blood and Wine DLC, Phantom Liberty is a must, better than the base game in some ways and it offers the best missions, so make sure to get it along the base game. The best time to play it  - I find - is right before going to the point of no return.
 Additionally here are a few tips that made my playthrough more enjoyable :

- Cars are mostly fixed but motorcycles feel and drive much better, I went for the Yaiba Kusagani CT3X as soon as  I could afford it and stuck with it for the remainder of my playthrough.

-Night City is clearly the jewel of this game and probably the best city ever made for a video game, so don’t use fast travel and don’t skip rides as often as you can you’d be missing out on a lot of gorgeous places to just drive through.

-You can disable the annoying RPG hitpoints that spill out of enemies when you hit them, to get a more traditional FPS feel. Doing so doesn’t hinder you at any point and bosses still have a health bar. The game looks and feels much better that way IMO.

-Do all the gigs and side missions, they are nice.

-Phantom Liberty has the best gigs and side missions so get it !

This game is so great i had to buy it for 80 Euro's after pirating it.
First off i had pirated this game as i was skeptical with its launch since i was waiting on this game for years. After getting close to the end i saw how great th9is game was after Phantom Liberty released and i bought it simply bringing over my savefile. The story is really fun and great, Characters have actual personality, Music that truly matches the universe , Fun weapon play, Diffrent playstyles with no locked in classes. DO i need to say more? No? Because i am going to say more the DLC enchances the game from about an 8/10 to a 9/10 it is simply that good with new locations in a large dangerous chunck off night city with sidequests and new variations off old things like criminal activity. The main game can feel shrt compared to other games yet the amount off voiced and rewarding sidequests its really great to walk around the world and do those.

The combat is either too easy or a level-check and AI is braindead. Many enemies are buggy and spend their turns running back and forth or clipping through a ladder.
The world is very pretty but feels closed and dead, it is also full of empty jars, vases, urns and barrels which serve no purpose but to bait you or waste your time. Your avatar also climbs on every table to pick items which further slows the exploration down and brings unintentional comedy on par with the intentional quips of Larian.
There are choices, sure, but it is usually the old: Save the orphanage / Burn the orphanage with no nuance. Characters are forgettable pricks who insult you constantly and if you call them out, you have to kill them - boom - quest failed and whole location is hostile.

1086940,"Amazing and rich story, with the most engaging, interesting, well written, well animated and well voice acted companions I've ever seen in a videogame. There is so much content that after playing for 500 hours, I’m still finding new stuff. Hell, the first time I finished the game I missed two companions and didn’t even notice. 

Just the companion quests are some of the best videogame content I've ever seen, and the game would be worth the price just for two of them.

At the time of this review, 7 major updates have been released, with an 8th one on the way. Each of these updates has improved the game (except for doors, those are still broken), its performance, and has added QoL improvements and content.

As an avid TTRPG player, this game has been the closest a videogame has come to providing the TTRPG experience. I can't think of a better compliment for a videogame, to be honest. The attention to detail is borderline insane, with such fringe scenarios that the devs have anticipated and made content for, that the many times it feels like a GM is there to run the game for you.

And the devs are just awesome and have released a toolkit that is allowing people to make mods that change core rules, add equipment and items, and even create whole new campaings. This move has probably cemented this game as the most long-lived videogame of the decade.

Baldur's Gate 3 has become my favourite videogame.

1086940,"[h1]This is a lovely game. However, Divinity: Original Sin 2 had better player interface. Let me explain:[/h1]

[h2]THE PRO'S[/h2]
[h3]I love the world of DND. It's a great fantasy world, and this game reflects it really well:[/h3]
[list]
[*]Classes and races mesh well;
[*]Skills and abilities are usually useful and can turn the tide of battle;
[*]Every upgrade that adds to your primary stats, and damage output, is meaningful;
[*]Your narrative choices are reflected through the campaign;
[/list]

[h2]THE CON'S[/h2]
[h3]As I mentioned before, there are some peculiar things that should be better. Those mainly boil down to a few particular issues:[/h3]
[list]
[*]How come am I able to melee attack thin air?
In a turn-based battle, i have wasted numerous turns, because i have misclicked my mouse (or the game does not register that my mouse hovers over an enemy), when i have an attack selected.
There is no reason why this should be in the game. By default, this should only happen when i press a modifier hotkey to allow attacks at thin air.
[*]How come am I attacking a structure, but not moving behind it, by default?
I have had few battles started because i wanted to move behind some object which has HP (such as wooden structures).
Clicking on such object, by default means that i either want to INTERACT or WALK AROUND.
There's even a hotkey to attack. Why is it in the game, if, without having it pressed down, my character attacks things that provoke conflicts?
[*]Walkable areas are not marked clearly, and while that in itself is not an issue, i should be able to ckeck, if an AOE fire spell will cover the entire passage between me and the enemy, or not.
[*]As I said, these are usually not an issue in D:OS2. In that game, attack is not the default action. You have to trigger it by holding down a hotkey, else your character would simply do whatever is considered the second prioritised action in BG3. Additionally, there is a hotkey to highlight walkable area, so that you could use the knowledge the game has, as intended.
[/list]

1086940,"Haven't finished the game yet, but I played enough to solidify my opinion on it. Baldur's Gate 3 is a great game that is a bit held back by the DnD 5e mechanics. 

I won't spend too much time singing praises since BG3 broke into the mainstream and it was very well-deserved. Larian Studios had already proved they could make an amazing CRPG with Divinity: Original Sin 2 and with the extra time they put into this game, their mastery shows. A lot of stuff to do, fun quests and dungeons, interesting characters to interact, great voice acting and good improvements from the TTRPG version of the mechanics. If you're looking for a fun, high-fantasy, tactical combat RPG with a lot of dialogue choices, go for it.

My two main complaints are with the multiplayer and the DnD 5e combat/progression mechanics. 

Regarding the multiplayer, I think it's mostly my preferences. There are clear improvements in comparison to DOS2 multiplayer in general, but I still feel like this is a game I'd rather enjoy on multiplayer co-op, while it's clearly designed with single-player in mind. You can still have a lot of fun with it, but it will make you miss out on a lot of the character-driven narratives and the general self-insertion story that these RPGs tend to aim for. Once again, I wouldn't say that that is necessarily bad, but it clashes with the way I prefer to play - and you can always play with each player using an origin character from the game.

Regarding the DnD mechanics, I think it's a straight downgrade from DOS2. Leveling up only in your class by default, action types instead of action points, daily and level up spell memorizing and all that, not fun in my book. These adaptations from DnD 5e add complexity that doesn't add tactical depth on one end and restrict choices and freedom on the other. Like I said, a lot of good changes from the TTRPG mechanics were made, but it's still a flawed system for me. 

In conclusion, I very much do reccomend Baldur's Gate 3. I think it's more polished and approachable than DOS 2 (even though the general mechanics are less fun, in my opinion) and deserves all the praise it has gotten. It's an awesome RPG adventure and clearly worth the price.",True,True,"n't finished game yet , played enough solidify opinion .

1086940,"This game is incredible...
I am inexperienced with proper D&D tabletop games, but I've always wanted to give it a try. I know this is somewhat different since you have saves you can load if you don't get an outcome you want, cause video game, but I find part of the fun for me is getting to play through this campaign over and over to experience the different paths and endings as you want to. No shame to people who don't want to save scum though, you live dangerously and I respect that, and I think this game is probably still rewarding to those who don't.

That aside, Larian really cooked with this, and are STILL in the kitchen even long after it's release. 
The game of the year award was so well deserved for this masterpiece. Everything from the visuals, to the gameplay, to the characters + character customisation and the classes, to the music, and even to the changelog and community update posts (your humour in them is fantastic and  so on-brand, thank you for hiring whoever it is that does those). This is the work of a games studio who actually care about the individual game they and their employees put great amount of efforts into being an enjoyable experience and playable even beyond a single year from it's release date. Not saying they are the only one's to do it, as there are plenty of other games out there that have achieved this feat, but rarely does it seem to apply to the vast majority of games that big game studios seem to churn out these days.

Even though my luck on rolls sucks when playing through this game at times, and I am an idiot who is still learning a lot of things about certain aspects (thank you ""load save"" feature for these reasons in particular lol), I still just struggle to put into exact words how good this game is and how strongly I recommend this to anyone who has taken even the slightest bit of interest in this game and are unsure on whether to play or not. We are well over a year out from the game being released, so I would like to think most people have by now, but if you haven't, please do. I promise it will be worth your time. This game will reward you tenfold.
Good luck, soldier!

It's pretty good, but the main story  and plot is hardcoded and essentially always follows the same path, regardless of your choices.

1086940,"Super fun and good looking game despite all the.... weird stuff and messaging for MODERN AUDIENCES.

Every character being a sexually ambiguous 5LU7 is something I could do without.

My biggest complaint is the rejection of Forgotten Realms canon, as if the writers truly hate the sourcebooks. Example: Tieflings and celestials are rare, and the prospect of many of them finding one another and creating a thriving breeding community is ridiculous even for a high fantasy game set in the realms. And they don't all have red skin and scales. Basically the whole tiefling refugees thing was such a cringe and unnecessary thing trying to force a parallel with modern global politics.

This may be a gripe with 5e and not the game itself, but truly concerning is the disappearance of moral good and evil, being replaced with arbitrary ""consequences"" of good and evil acts. In the real world AND any fantasy world we are allowed to roleplay within, our choices aren't just guided by our selfish desire for certain future results. ""I won't kill this person because if I do I will miss out on the chance to purchase goods from them in a later act"" isn't how civilized humans make decisions. Everyone knows there is good, and there is evil, and to pretend they don't exist reveals a very bad agenda from the development team. Bad for everyone, whether it's a kid playing for the story or a group of friends playing for the lolz. Either way the pretense that good and evil don't exist, only legal and social consequences, leads to a very watered down and sterile gaming experience. If I do murder, I want the game to treat me like a murderer. If I stop murder from happening, I want the game to treat me like a hero. This game seems to obfuscate both so that no matter what you do, nothing really happens and everything is just this grey area of excuses.",True,True,"Super fun good looking game despite .... weird stuff messaging MODERN AUDIENCES .

 [h2] A one in a lifetime experience[/h2] 

Baldur's Gate 3 is my first in a lot of case
1. Its my first ever CRPG
2. My first ever over the top CRPG
3. First D&D style game

Going into this game I had a lot of reservations, there was never any doubt that this is a once in generation game and the best this genre has ever seen. The question was, is this game for me. I was skeptical even through the mindflare section, it was o out of place for someone who has played and been in love with third person action since childhood. I have spent countless hours in RPGs but this seemed too complicated to start. Controlling four characters seemed convoluted, but I was in a quest. 

My quest to complete all the GOTYs I had missed over the years and Baldur's Gate seemed too much of a challenge to take on. I am glad my stubborn mind pushed through these inhibitions. I am proud of myself for pushing through as Baldur's Gate 3 first playthrough will probably be one of the best gaming experiences in my life. My only regret would be I wont be be able to experience ""first"" playthrough ever again. When the credits roll BG3 left me with a sense of gloom that I probably didnt experience before. Its a unique feeling that I hope more people should experience the ""first"" time. I genuinely and truly believe that the reception and global appeal this game has received doesnt do enough justice to the absurd feat that Larian Studios has pulled off and I am thankful to them for giving me something to cherish for the rest of my life.

1086940,"This is almost completely subjective; the game has a legit claim on the title of greatest RPG ever made. I just don't like it.

There are so many decisions in this game that bother me. I play tabletop RPGs for real, I don't need to watch virtual dice rolls. I don't like the constant narrator endlessly droning on about everything. There's a ton of other things I really dislike in this game, a lot of it baggage with modern D&D.

Shit, why isn't Karlach in the damn cover art?

You hear endless tales of people doing crazy shit, juggling people off cliffs or throwing cursed fish or whatever, the game ""let's you do anything you want"". I played a necromancer and 90% of dead people have absolutely nothing to say. the remaining 10% have nothing to say I can't already figure out. I'm not expecting full dialogue trees from every body in the game, even from the insane detail of this game, but it would have been nice to find a stash of loot or something now and then.

Never seen an RPG world with this much depth and verticallity, rather than flat planes with cliffs and plateaus. I dreaded the game being full of exploding barrels and that tactics revolved around ""throw shit at things"", but there's so many things that interact in different ways along with solid movement and ability use. 

The characters are damn amazing. Why isn't Karlach on the cover? I want a mod to have everyone in the party at once so nobody gets left behind. It's a real pity Asterion doesn't seem to have any real plot until the end of the game, when everyone else gets real moments to shine. It's really damn disappointing that Alfira seems like she should have been the bard character but her role in the game is to get butchered by the Dark Urge. And yeah, looks like NOT playing the Dark Urge was the chump option, you've played the game incorrectly if you didn't pick it or an origin companion. Dragonborn are so awesome looking it's basically a crime none appear until Act 3.

Act three is messy. Buggiest part of the game. The only major crash I had happened there and forced me to replay a long, complex encounter. The narrator crapped out and went silent which actually didn't bother me too much.

And after 170 something hours of a campaign, I finished the game and basically got the modern equivalent of ""You get Win!"". I made a heroic sacrifice, watched a companion die, saw Withers basically laugh at the previous games, and then credits rolled before being dumped to the main menu. So the worst bug I encountered was apparently ""lol, no ending for you"", which is pretty fucking devastating.

I'm so glad I'm finally done with the game and can stop playing it. I'll probably start another game in the future. I'm very much torn between love and hate with this game which unfortunately averages out to ""just knock it off already, dammit"" most of the time.",False,True,"almost completely subjective ; game legit claim title greatest RPG ever made . n't like . many decisions game bother . play tabletop RPGs real , n't need watch virtual dice rolls . n't like constant narrator endlessly droning everything .

Sure, they spent a lot of money and time on the in-game animations and dialog, but as a fan of other CRPGs that rely more on text I found it a bit boring.  My biggest pet peeve though was the cap at level 12.  I literally played the last quarter of the game at the level cap.  The extra XP I received could have easily led me to level 18.

1086940,"Now... there's subjective reasons for me not recomending this game, and there's quite a few objective reasons as well.

Subjective ones:
1; The story never really clicked with me, which makes it really hard to put up with the kinda slow and clunky gameplay. I usually don't have an issue with gameplay similar to this, and I prefer turnbased combat if possible. But turns can take a very long time in this game, and outside of a few gimmicks you can pull off (that are staple for Larian, and I already got tired of in D:OS2), every combat ends up feeling very samey. Without a story to keep my engagement the game just felt like a slog.

2; I found most of the companions to be annoying and/or not interesting at all. My favorite would probably be Gale... but the writing is so juvenile that he tries to get into my pants after 1-2 days of adventuring. I don't mind romance in games, or even sex scenes, but if they're this shallow it just feels like the developers are going ""We know what you're here for! Here you go! Just pick whatever character you want to do the dirty with and talk with them a little bit!""

Objective reasons:
1; The camera is god awful. It gets stuck in the terrain more often then not. Sometimes refuses to look inside buildings even tho my characters are already inside said building. And sometime it just spazzes out completely, flies of in a random direction and just get stuck at max distance and doing this terrible shaking. Not to mention that you can't look up, at least I've found no way of doing this. Something you'd think would be important in a game that puts a big focus on verticality, but no, you have to stand in certain specific spots for the camera to zoom out and let you see that, yes, there's a platform here you could jump to.

2; Bugs and glitches galore. I would have assumed most of the common bugs would have been ironed out by now, but seems Larian doesn't agree. I've lost count of how many times some of my characters have just started floating in mid air, as if standing on some invisible extra floor a bit of the ground, no longer being able to interact with anything because it's ""out of reach"". A save and reload usually fixed the issue, sometimes I had to reload a previous save. However, it's a very annoying thing when it happens so frequently. 

There's also been multiple occasions where I've told a character to attack a door/barricade, and they instead just end up on the other side of it. Not the biggest of issues perhaps, unless the thing I was going to destroy would have spawned the actual entrance to another area, and it can't be attacked from the other side... just reload a save I guess.

1086940,"Initially, when I started playing Baldur's Gate 3, my experience was surprisingly underwhelming. The complexity of the game's mechanics, overwhelming dialogues, and intricate combat system felt daunting, making my first impressions somewhat negative. I wasn't immediately drawn into its vast world or captivated by its storytelling, which felt slow-paced at first. However, everything changed dramatically once I began playing with friends.

Teaming up transformed my entire perception of Baldur's Gate 3. What initially seemed tedious suddenly became immensely entertaining. Coordinating strategies, laughing at unexpected outcomes, and exploring the richly detailed environments together created an experience unlike any other. The multiplayer aspect significantly elevated the gameplay, adding a sense of camaraderie, unpredictability, and shared adventure that truly brought the game's expansive content to life.

One of Baldur's Gate 3's standout features is its deep and rewarding combat system. Every encounter feels unique, requiring thoughtful strategies, careful positioning, and clever use of spells and abilities. Playing with friends makes these battles even more enjoyable as cooperation becomes essential. Strategizing together to overcome challenging enemies or hilarious failures due to miscommunication makes each session memorable.

Beyond combat, Baldur's Gate 3 offers an incredibly immersive storytelling experience. The characters are beautifully crafted, with rich backstories, meaningful interactions, and impactful decisions that resonate deeply. Each choice has tangible consequences, shaping the narrative uniquely with every playthrough. Completing the game twice, totaling over 350 hours, I discovered new story arcs, secrets, and character interactions, highlighting the game's astonishing replayability and depth.

Visually, the game is a masterpiece, filled with lush environments, detailed character models, and stunning magical effects. The world feels alive and expansive, enticing exploration at every turn. Accompanied by an exceptional musical score, the audio-visual experience perfectly complements the narrative and gameplay, immersing players fully into the Forgotten Realms.

In conclusion, although my initial encounter with Baldur's Gate 3 was less than ideal, sticking with it and experiencing the game alongside friends completely changed my opinion. Its deep gameplay mechanics, immersive storytelling, exceptional visuals, and unparalleled multiplayer experience make it one of the most rewarding RPGs I've ever played. Whether you're a fan of the genre or exploring RPGs for the first time, Baldur's Gate 3 deserves your time and patience. Dive in with friends, and you'll discover a profoundly rewarding and endlessly entertaining adventure.

The story is gripping and will keep you engaged throughout the three acts of the game. Each choice you make in the game has a direct or indirect impact in some way as you progress the story which I loved and made me contemplate every decision I made. The main story is an amazing and emotional journey with the conclusion of it being satisfying but also wanting more at the same time. The story is compelling and constantly kept me up at night till the AMs to find out what happens next. Moreover, your party companions and the side characters all have interesting back stories and quests to follow along your journey. 

This game had a spectacular cast of characters. All characters including minor to major NPCs were well-voiced acted and professional mo-capped which added to the immersion and the emotional impact of story events. 
This game had one the best stories I have experienced and I wish I could play it again for the first time.

This is my first experience with a CRPG and I loved it. Furthermore, the gameplay is directly inspired by Dungeons and Dragons which I had little experience of, but after a learning curve, I have grown to love it. Everything is decided by a roll of dice which is fun, difficult (in a good way) and strategic. I have always had a love for turn-based games and this game does in a way that I was not used to but it pushed me to learn and be engaged in every way.

Dialogue is even decided by dice, which can be frustrating at times but the game can be very forgiving, giving you ways to buff or re-try your rolls for important story moments.

Graphics of BG3 were not industry-leading or anything like that but it is still quite beautiful. The world and its each region was well-detailed and immersive. Performance can be inconsistent, there are times where actions can lag after a couple seconds particularly in Act 3. In my first play-through I did run into major performance issues in Act 3 which made it pretty much unplayable, then a week later Larian Studios released Patch 5 which fixed most of the issues which made the performance in Act 3 become passable.

The character interactions feel genuine. The characters have their own agency, even going so far as breaking up with you if you do something they don't agree with and leaving the party. The voice acting & motion capture is phenomenal. Decisions from Act 1 have overarching stories that follow you all the way to act 3. There's nuance to decisions where there isn't a cut and dry right or wrong situation and I love that morally grey aspect so much. Their environmental story telling had me ugly crying in the arcane tower. I have never seen a studio care about a game like Larian does. The actors were all offered intimacy coordinators for romance scenes, they listen to their fanbase and take those critiques into consideration for the next patch; even something as small as a random NPC saying something like ""What, am I going to pull a chicken out of my skirt?"" but she was wearing pants and in patch 7, they gave her a skirt.

1086940,"Late to the review game on this because I was too busy playing it! It's the best D&D based game ever. The absolute best part for me is playing it with friends.  If it has in game communication, I don't know what that is (we just use phone to talk while playing and we can hear slight sync variances).  

There are the usual live server issues, some days more than others.   There are also some bugs/glitches, but you generally figure out how to deal with or compensate for them over time.  For me the most frequent and repetitive (in multiplayer mode) is that it wont display any conversation options when you know it should be (for the active of the two+ players), which then requires that you reboot the game and start from where the conversation was last saved to get those options to display for the character making the choices.

Separately, it does have an optional rogue or rogue-lite mode (only save is where you stop, death is permanent), which. if you complete it awards a special set of dice.  The award is minor, but that mode does have a 'feel' to it that is really cool, if you like that sort of challenge.  Given that the game is so huge and some of the bosses can be very challenging when you can not scum save, its good that this mode does have scalable difficulty.  

I would recommend that if you like this sort of mode that you play it before playing all the way through the story in the scum-savable mode because you can exhaust the story options and replayability easier in scum save mode, whereas in the rogue mode, each replay will open up more variability to keep things interesting.  Caveat to that may be to play for a bit in scum savable mode (till you have beat one or two bosses) just to understand the basic mechanics and threat levels before going rogue.  But otherwise, the rogue mode is pretty cool. 

Even if you normally don't like rogue mode (or have never tried it and think you would not), consider that tabletop D&D is basically played in rogue mode... unless you have a very forgiving dungeon master, you live with the consequences of all your choices.  So where I don't always like rogue games, here, it feels very true to the original gameplay and adds to the enjoyment in that way (for me. ymmv). 

Another thing to know is that if you choose a default character over a custom one, you are likely to get additional story lines tied to those characters.  Like for instance, playing as Gale, you will have his cat show up with gifts and conversation at times, where the cat is just set dressing if Gale is in your party as other than your main character.  So, this adds to replayability, too, getting to see what things come up that are unique to the pre-configured characters you choose to play.  Given that you can generously respec characters, this means you may want to try characters whose classes/races are not your usual thing, just to see what the story variations are (you can always respec them to your style).",True,True,"Late review game busy playing !

1086940,"I'm someone who doesn't play a lot of video games. I had a few PC games like Myst and Wolfenstein 3D as a kid, and I was a huge Rareware fan in the N64 days, but the most recent video game I'd gotten into before this was Final Fantasy X. Modern games and I don't really get along. I can't ever remember all the controls for each game, I forget what I'm doing and pieces of lore between sessions, the controls always feel overly sensitive, and sometimes FPS cams make me nauseous. Steam says I've dropped 1500hrs into Baldur's Gate 3. Steam doesn't always pick up my hours accurately, and it's closer to 2K. Two THOUSAND hours of my life, 20 years after I'd mostly stopped gaming, dropped into this game, and counting.

Larian has put a lot of time and love into this game, and it shows. The turn-based combat gives me time to think about my next move without pressure, which is great when I've been working long hours and my reaction time is worthless. The UI is very easy to understand and is both functional for beginners and has features for more advanced players. The camera moves confidently and doesn't feel jumpy. On top of 4 main difficulty modes, custom difficulty allows you to give yourself proficiency bonuses if you're super new and just want to experience the story, or give yourself negatives if you want more of a challenge.

The story is delightful, the worlds and cutscene cinematography beautiful, the companions engaging. Depending on how you play, you get to experience each of them in different ways, and of course each has their own playable story. I've often described Act 1 as a playable movie. You can rush it, but I feel the game rewards you for going slowly and taking your time to do everything. Larian has recommended playing as a custom Tav first before the companions or Dark Urge -- a customizable character whose story will be familiar to players of the previous Baldur's Gate games. IMO this is great advice, since the Urge can have quite an effect on how you experience the game, especially in Acts 2 & 3, even if you choose to resist it, but moreso of course if you embrace.

I've been playing on Steam Deck, but I've been inspired to build a new PC because of BG3, in anticipation of whatever Larian has coming next.

I recommend you play the dark urge plot-line. It added so much more depth to my character's lore, but also a layer of difficulty to the play-through - as dialogue becomes a focal point as apposed to just fighting/strategy. Sometimes, this game can be a little draining - especially if you aren't playing it the way you want. Take your time. Involve yourself with the characters and the world. Download mods if that helps.

I'm not much into round based games but i got used to it. To be honest as an anxious gamer i appreciate this type of combat now because there is no time pressure or panic-brain-freeze. 

It was perfect for me that i waited over a year to buy it because now there are so many fixes and mods (i get them on nexusmods.com) so i can mod it to the perfect game for me. You can even mod spiders into dogs appearance for those with arachnophobia. Be aware that there are kinky/spicy scenes and romanes you can encounter if you want.

I love the interactions so much and the graphics are just stunnig. So many clothing and equipment possibilities! (To be fair you should tidy up you inventory as good as possible to not have chaos).

I highly recomment to follow the Motioncapture actors like Neil Newbon - who was the actor for Astarion - on social Media. It is so wholesome to watch these guys being funny, adorable and they even do DND based live-events where they explore as their figures.

1086940,"I admit I was pretty late to the excitement of this game from when it initially came out in 2023. A good friend of mine bought me a copy so that we could play this game together, and it did take me a little bit of getting used to. But after enough time playing both by myself and with friends I can say hands down it's not only one of my favorite RPG experiences in recent year, but one of the quintessential PC gaming cornerstone.

As somebody who enjoys both single player experiences and things like tabletop gaming this game easily scratches both those itches and does so with ... one of those, uh... really nice wooden back-scratcher's that's satisfying to use. I know next to little about actual D&D lore, and even without that experience it does a great job at weaving a narrative that's not only easy to digest, but really helps you immerse yourself in the story it tells.

The game-play is a great blend of isometric adventuring and turn based combat, and dances the line between the two really gracefully. Even just beyond the player character, every member of the party you can acquire in the game you can customize to your heart's content to suit what ever manner of play style best suits what you're aiming for.

My biggest reason for wanting to write a review for this game though has to hands down be how wonderful the game's developers at Larian Studios have shown love for the game in it's many many updates. 

Multiplayer is a delight, and even more so the integration of cross platform compatibility AND an active and very sociable modding community whom Larian openly embraces. The togetherness of players and developers is something really rare to see--Even with other modding juggernauts like a lot of Bethesda's RPGs, there isn't such a truly unified community as what gold Larian's struck here.

1086940,"DISCLAIMER: I'm someone who prefers more 'theatrical DnD' that's made more for an audience in mind (ex: Dimension 20/NaDDPOD) as opposed to more traditional DnD experience with all the crunchi-ness that it entails.
Anywho, here's my review after beating the game with just under 100 hours on the save file and doing almost every side quest along the way:

Pros:
- Very robust character creation options
- Can even choose to play as characters that would normally be optional party members for a more concrete background and established story
- Choosing one class to play as doesn't perma-lock you out of other classes or gameplay experiences since there's a way you can change your class whenever you want during your play through without facing and real negative consequences
- The world [i]actually[/i] changes based on how you play, and not in small ways either. Different quests, characters, dialog options, and relationships can be unlocked or cut off based on how you play and what characters think of you, which gives a lot of replay value to make different choices and see what happens
- Combat is fun, flows well, and feels good to play
- You can pretty much play as any character you want with the different enchants you can find on weapons, armour, and jewelry
- The story is very engaging, and there's multiple ways you can go about finishing the game, with different end scenes based on how you played
- You can quick save, try something, and if it goes wrong you can just load the quick save and try again. Yay for easy retry system with no punishments!
- Several party members to recruit as you play for several different party comps that can change how fights work and even give different NPC interactions depending on who you have in your party, which also lends itself to encourage multiple play throughs

Cons:
- Outside of combat/direct story advancements it felt pretty slow. Sometimes it felt like a chore to start up the game and play for an hour to get to the parts I was actually interested in (probably just a me thing, see my disclaimer at the beginning)
- With the game being split up into three acts, the world you can explore as a whole isn't really that big. Acts 1, 2, and 3 area huge when combined, but individually it's not as large as it may seem. Can also be a good thing though to help keep the players from getting overwhelmed, but I found it a negative
- I have a standard laptop (not optimized for gaming or anything in any real way) but even playing with all the graphics on low quality it [i]still[/i] takes like 10 to load in a new area. Until then walls are invisible, textures are very polygonal, shadows don't exist, etc. I know I'm not using a high end gaming desktop or anything, but even with everything on low quality it's annoying that things still struggle to load on a decent standard laptop
- They have two dice skins you can choose from (unless you ordered a special version or beat the game on the hardest difficulty), which seems like such a wasted area since you roll the dice dozens of times each play session. You'll need to install some mods for custom dice if you want more
- Some weapon classes are favored more than others, having more unique weps with special enchantments/effects than others have (tons of swords, daggers, and great swords with hardly any flails, tridents, or handaxes by comparison)


TL:DR;
- The boss fights were great, I can't think of any that felt like a copy/paste of other fights
- The world changes to reflect how you play in meaningful ways, actually leading to numerous different dialogs, NPC interactions, and other plot points that really makes the choices you make feel like they matter
- Felt kinda slow outside of action/story moments
- The world map isn't as big as it seems, but still a good size to explore
- Had some loading lags, even with all quality settings set to low, which was annoying
- Definitely a fun game, will probably be playing it more in the future for some achievement hunting play-throughs

1086940,"Started the game, got mind-flayed. 10 minutes later, I’m looting corpses, setting a goblin camp on fire, and somehow in a love triangle with a vampire and a demon lady. Standard RPG experience.

Pros:
✅ You can seduce a bear. No, really.
✅ Dice rolls decide your fate, just like real life. (Mostly failure.)
✅ Accidentally committed arson, nobody questioned it.
✅ Every conversation is either diplomacy or maximum war crimes. No in-between.
✅ Karlach exists. That’s it. That’s the pro.

Cons:
❌ I tried to jump across a gap and missed. Died instantly.
❌ Owlbear cub is cute, but will 100% eat your face off.
❌ My rogue failed a stealth check inside their own shadow.
❌ Accidentally romanced a certain dark elf. Now I sleep with one eye open.
❌ Lae’zel called me a pathetic worm, and I liked it.

Final Verdict: 11/10. Accidentally made enemies with a squirrel, now my whole party is dead. GOTY.

Ps. Would Accidentally Romance a Tentacle Monster Again, 100%.

They did my girl Karlach dirty though and it always hurts me feelings thinking about it. The combat is refined and tactical. The freedom of choice is excellent. This is about as close to playing a real DnD game as you are going to get away from the tabletop.

Some things I didn't like though: There are story threads that the game doesn't really wrap up that are a big deal to the characters and get you invested. The devs don't want to do anything more with the game regarding those things they set up. That's disappointing because there is a lot of potential there. There is also a rushed feel to the polish of the final conflict of the game. It has a vibe like they were getting tired of making it and wanted to wrap it up. There were also some substantial bugs during my play through, especially regarding playing co-op with friends that were using Mac. There were times we couldn't even play. It might be resolved though. I played this game so much that I need to take a break from it for a while.

Cons:
It is not a perfect game by any stretch. The writing was oftentimes immature, naive, and maybe even cringeworthy at times. 
If you aren't a fan of turn-based battles, you may not like much of the combat.

Pros: 
STORY.  It is very easy to set aside the juvenile writing and enjoy each and every character in the game (not just your main party). Side quests are fantastic. The main quest is cogent and epic.
RPG development - you really can build whatever you want and develop into a powerhouse of whatever class you pick. The pacing of this is superb. They did a fine job not letting the game get too easy (though it does by the time you get done with Act 3 as your characters have a ton of power by then).
Soundtrack - I can't think of a game that sounded better than this game. The music is absolutely delightful, moving, and emotional. 
Voice acting - having everything voice acted really does make a huge difference in immersion.

It's made me laugh, cry, and rage. Both in writing, and in design - this game is absolutely fantastic but not without flaws either. Be warned, this game can be as long or as short as you make it to me. I made it long, and I don't regret that. But it can feel like you are lost at sea at some points, especially in the first act when the plot hasn't fully started yet and there are a thousand side quests between you and your objective. You start off with a group of vagabond weirdos doomed to die and you end up (hopefully) a group of friends bound by fate and heroic antics.

1086940,"Played BG1 and 2 after this, and my god was the writing better back in those days. I mean I actually found it fun and interesting to read the dialogues, and I often laughed out loud. (I played them alot growing up) BG3 and Larians style is just abyssmal, loud and obnoxious, clicheed and frankly boring. The moments where I think there are attempts at humour (?) were just so bad I wanted to uninstall. I had the same issue with DOS2. BG3s lack of charm also makes it overstay its welcome. By act2 I am exhausted by it, and act3 is spent rushing through to get it done. I've finished it twice, and had the same feeling both times. There is nothing charming about the game. Oh, and the game is too easy, too sexual, has too much inventory management, a really really ugly map system, and many many other irritating issues.

HOWEVER, the combat system is so much FUN. I know it is DnD5 rules, and Larians implementation of the rules makes for such a fun combat system. I cant wait for BG4, which is thankfully not going to be written by Larian. Hopefully they get back to the writing style of the good old games, but keeps the combat intact.

It's a game that in just a couple of hours of gameplay managed to drag me into a long adventure of 450+ hours, where each new playthrough can feel like a completely new experience due to the variety of choices. 

It is an incredibly interesting game, both in terms of its storyline: from the characters' stories that can make you truly sympathise with them, to the various dialogues with many options for replicas and responses to them. And the functional/gameplay component. 
This game made me both happy when I laughed at silly lines or situations I got into because of another ""critical fail"", but also managed to make me cry because of the truly painful stories of the characters. 

And in the end, I can't help but mention the MOST important thing that makes this passage even more enjoyable and understandable for perception: the full Ukrainian localisation, for which I am just incredibly grateful.

1086940,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ – Totally NOT Just Playing for the Hot Vampire

Oh wow, what a surprise. Another totally normal RPG where I start out as a brave adventurer, full of hope, only to end up committing crimes, making morally bankrupt choices, and falling for a pale, knife-happy vampire who absolutely wants to kill me.

Astarion? Oh, he’s great. A real sweetheart. The kind of guy who flirts with you one second and then casually reminds you he’d love to sink his teeth into your neck (but like, in a cute way?). My character is fully aware this man is a walking red flag, but do I care? Absolutely not.

The game itself? Oh yeah, it’s fine. The story is deep, the combat is strategic, and the world is full of immersive, meaningful choices—all of which I ignore in favor of trying to impress my undead boyfriend.

Aside from that I am a ""Villain protagonist"" enthusiast, this is probably the best villain protagonist experience I have had in an RPG game. It is unapologetic in the terror you inflict on others as a Dark Urge or just an unforgivably evil Tav. The creative freedom for roleplay is boundless in both villain and hero roleplays that allow for great dynamic villain characters. 

I simply wished there was more content that was exclusive to evil routes as being evil does come at a cost of losing storylines, compainions, questlines and loot.

1086940,"Baldur's Gate 3 is nothing short of an absolute masterpiece. From the very first moments, I was captivated by its depth, rich storytelling, and the sheer amount of freedom it offers. The game perfectly blends classic RPG elements with modern mechanics, delivering an experience that feels both nostalgic and incredibly fresh.

The world-building is top-notch. The Forgotten Realms have never felt more alive, with every area filled with rich lore, dynamic characters, and meaningful choices that truly impact the story. The characters you meet along the way are some of the most compelling I’ve encountered in any game—each with their own personalities, struggles, and motivations. It's the kind of game where you genuinely care about your companions, and their fates feel just as important as your own.

What stands out the most, though, is the incredible freedom the game offers. The ability to make choices that truly matter, whether it's how you approach a conversation or the path you take through a dungeon, means that no two playthroughs are ever the same. The combat system is strategic and satisfying, offering a balance of tactical depth without feeling overwhelming, especially for newcomers to the genre.

The level of detail in the game is astonishing. From the intricate character customization options to the beautifully crafted environments, it’s clear that Larian Studios poured their heart and soul into this project. The dialogue, voice acting, and cutscenes are stellar, making it easy to get lost in the game for hours at a time.

Overall, Baldur's Gate 3 is a triumph. It’s an RPG that not only meets but exceeds expectations, and it's a game that I’ll remember for a long time. I couldn’t recommend it more highly to any fan of RPGs or anyone looking for an immersive, well-crafted adventure.

Very well written characters and its very fun to watch the stories of all your companions play out. If you haven't seen any of this game yet or haven't played it, please do so before anything gets spoiled for you. Its incredibly fun to play from the beginning fresh without any knowledge on what can happen without the fear of getting 'the best ending'. Will say that Act III had simultaneously the most and least strong grip on me as while its still fun and primarily interesting to see your companion's stories wrapping up in mostly satisfying ways, it definitely feels like the two of the main bosses are shoehorned in too close to one another. Perhaps the game would have benefited from a 4th act, though I know it was in development for a long time so chances are if they were able to add a 4th act I'd imagine they'd have done so.

I already love turn-based tabletop RPGs, but Baldur’s Gate 3—or rather, Larian—has managed to capture the magic of classic pen and paper and translate it into a truly unique game.

With this game, told through a three-act structure, Larian has created a one-of-a-kind gaming experience. I wish I could experience it again for the first time.

For me, Baldur’s Gate 3 is an 11/10, and I can’t wait to see what other bangers Larian will release in the future.

 - Can often feel like you are missing every attack. Regularly landing blows is part of the previously mentioned learning curve.

2: Story is amazing. It is such a gripping tale that you choose the outcome of! Ever since DA origins I have been in love with fantasy games where your choices matter. This game delivers. 10/10
3: Graphics. I have never seen or expected to see a crpg game with this good of graphics. It's seriously amazing. 10/10

5: Depth. This game is the most ambitious project ever.

What strikes you is the depth of the plot. Behind every mission, every quest, lie mysteries, rich lore, love stories beautifully animated and written for some, personal stakes, and moral dilemmas. The characters that accompany you are not just there to guide you : they live, evolve, and each has their own history and past. You cannot ignore them.

Longer answer. First play through I got a little into act 3, but had skipped so much that I was really under leveled and decided it was just easier to start over. I finally got a second run all the way to the final boss and one of the cutscenes crashed the game. I looked everywhere for answers and couldn't fix it. I think it was a mod, but even disabling the mods didn't fix it. That 60 hour run is just dead. Then I just kept getting distracted making new characters and have about half a dozen runs somewhere in act 1 and 2.

The tactical combat is fun, intuitive, and it feels great to set up combo's and positions and you have complete freedom to set up whatever party composition and synergy you would like, it's really easy to make each playthrough feel unique and that freedom also applies to resolutions for quests and encounters, I've done 5 play throughs and I've never really resolved a situation the same way multiple times, I'm still figuring out and learning new ways to win and discovering things I hadn't in my prior playthroughs.

1086940,"My opinion Overall.
There probably will not be, anytime soon or perhaps ever another game that gives you the amount of Quality/Quantity, this game delivers in content, replay-ability, character development, story, and attention to detail in its genre of games. Hell, in all games in general.
Obviously made by people who play, love, and know what the people who play this genre of game expect, and want. BG3 by Larian Studios set the bar impossibly high. I'm spoiled by this game, and it has only diminished the joy of other RPG games, because my expectations are now so much higher, and most game companies aren't willing to deliver the grand experience this game has given me. 
I have over 100 hours in my first campaign alone, and am still finding new content in my 2nd and 3rd campaigns. 
Buy once and Enjoy for ever, all content and future content is free. Rare these days indeed, most companies want to nickel and dime you for everything.

With exceptionally deep role-playing opportunities, complex and interesting combat mechanics, wonderful visuals, and great writing, Baldur’s Gate 3 is now counted among my favorite games ever. The bar has been raised for what is possible in the AAA role-playing space - let’s see if anyone can ever match it.

I've heard it isn't a true DND experience from my friends who play DND, which i dont doubt, but I have enjoyed every moment so far, and the same friends who say this, play the game and enjoy it just as much!

Started Baldur’s Gate 3 expecting an epic RPG adventure. Ended up treating it like a dating sim with occasional combat.

✔ Persuasion checks? Failed. Often.
✔ Accidentally setting things on fire? More than I’d like to admit.
✔ Reloading a save because Astarion didn’t approve? Every. Single. Time.

At this point, I’m less concerned about saving the world and more about keeping my emotionally unavailable vampire boyfriend happy. Priorities.

1086940,"A great RPG game to play through 1 to 3 times. Also playing co-op with a group of 4 friends is a beautiful and hilarious experience.
The gameplay and combat is great, I love trying different character builds and every combat encounter is brilliantly designed.

The story and characters are the bad side of the game. All characters are weak, emasculated, gay, whiny or depraved and unhinged. 
The story is not properly paced nor well incorporated into the rest of the game. It's an okay motivator to go on until you see that it's all just on paper and is of no import and influence to your gameplay style and decisions.
There's little room to actually roleplay, since you'll miss out on most of the content if you try to roleplay as a bad person, and everyone will constantly try to chide you and parent you out of doing it.

In summary, a great game engine and system, wish they would've worked on some expansions or different stories inside it, since this one is not so great.",True,True,"great RPG game play 1 3 times .

1086940,"Baldur’s Gate 3 is an absolute triumph in the RPG genre! The game delivers a perfect blend of deep storytelling, intricate character development, and a world full of choices that truly matter. The voice acting is phenomenal, making every interaction feel alive, while the writing is some of the best I’ve encountered in a game.

The combat system, based on D&D 5e rules, is challenging but rewarding, offering plenty of opportunities for strategic thinking and creative problem-solving. Whether you’re exploring the vast world, engaging in tense battles, or experiencing personal character arcs, everything feels polished and thoughtfully designed.

The world itself is stunning, with every area filled with secrets to uncover, NPCs to interact with, and quests that can go in unexpected directions depending on the choices you make.

I can't bring myself to do an evil run but even doing basically the same goody two shoes runs again and again, I see new content every playthrough, and am constantly surprised by the possible actions and their permutations that Larian specifically accounted for. You'd be hard-pressed to do something they didn't have a contingency for built-in.

I very very rarely buy AAA games, or really anything over $30. This game could've been double the price and I'd have happily paid it knowing just how much enjoyment I'd get out of it. 

Overall, I highly recommend if you like very deep and complex RPG's in general, especially if you already have an affinity for Dungeons & Dragons.

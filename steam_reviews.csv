620,"I don’t remember signing up for this. Maybe I did. I have no idea how long I have been here. Maybe I’ve always been here. The voice tells me to solve puzzles, so I do. The voice is not kind.
The cubes are my only companions. Some of them have hearts. Some of them scream. I try not to think about it.

I reach new heights, solve impossible puzzles... but it’s never enough. Each solution opens another door, and yet, the more I solve, the more I feel trapped. The game promises freedom, but does anyone truly escape?

I am either a genius or a very obedient lab rat. Possibly both.
But none of that matters. There is only the next test.",True
620," I want to say this, i dont think valve is making a portal 3. But for the last portal game, its great, good story, though, some achevments are a bit odd In my say.",True
620,"Ah, Portal 2. The portal gun is iconic. When platforming games and puzzle games are done well it can make for a very satisfying game but when they are both done well with a unique concept/mechanics.... *chef's kiss*

If you somehow don't know anything about the portal series, or if you're just considering trying it out, go for it. It is truly unique and iconic. OR, if you're like me and you have it but never finished it, I highly recommend you do so.

6/50",True
620,Portal 2 is one game I hesitated to get it but believe the reviews the game is super fun and challenging. Even in co op mode the levels are very intriguing there is no music just focus on the challenge with your friends. Game has very limited pieces of operation but complex combination which leads to interesting gameplay. Some levels were required lot of thinking to solve. Worth the time. If you like simple puzzle games. Best co-op I played till now.,True
620,this gotta one of my favorite games to play in my free time its fun and has a good story and characters. the co op is fun aswell to play and so are the community maps i recommend,True
620,"Takes what the first game did, and builds on it. It was such a refreshing experience after playing the first game, I especially loved the later sections of the game with the gels.",True
620,"I know I’m a bit late to this game,But figuring things out in such an atmosphere with this story was a great experience even today. Plus, it’s one of the few games my PC can actually handle. Wish I played it sooner!",True
620,"Portal 2 is a phenomenal continuation to the original Portal game. The sequel improves on the first game in every single aspect thus creating a perfect sequel to an already a original game with unique design and concept. Portal 2 is nothing but spectacular game which remains to be exceptionally fun and rewarding despite having no violence and just pure puzzle solving. Not only the the 2nd game improves on everything; gameplay, story, challenge/difficulty, soundtrack, and duration, the game also adds a whole new campaign for the co-op experience which is very interesting and more than welcome addition!",True
620,"For me, Portal has always been such a fun puzzle game. The first time I played it was at a friend's house on their Xbox 360. I still remember sitting in their room, controller in hand, completely mesmerized by the concept of the portal gun. The way it allowed you to bend space, creating solutions that felt impossible at first glance, was unlike anything I had ever played before.

Back then, it was a game that I loved but couldn’t play for myself. I didn’t have the means to own a copy, so my experiences with it were limited to those moments at my friend’s house—short bursts of brilliance before I had to pass the controller back. Even so, Portal left an impression on me. It wasn’t just the puzzles that stuck with me; it was the atmosphere, the eerie silence of the test chambers, the cold yet strangely comedic presence of GLaDOS, and the subtle story that unfolded as you progressed.

When Portal 2 was announced, I was beyond excited. But once again, I faced the same problem—I couldn’t play it myself. Watching trailers and hearing people talk about it only fueled my anticipation. It wasn’t just a sequel; it was an expansion of everything that made the first game special. The humor was sharper, the story was richer, and the puzzles were more complex.

Eventually, I finally got the chance to play Portal 2, and it exceeded every expectation I had. The puzzles were nothing short of genius. While the first game introduced the mechanics and let players experiment, the sequel built upon that foundation with new elements like Excursion Funnels, Aerial Faith Plates, Hard Light Bridges, and the incredible Repulsion, Propulsion, and Conversion Gels. Each of these additions made the puzzles feel more dynamic and engaging, requiring players to think in new and creative ways.

Now, about the story… wait, Portal 2 had a story? You mean to tell me the game wasn’t just about flinging myself through portals and occasionally being called fat by a supercomputer? If you squint hard enough at the dialogue between test chambers, there’s apparently some kind of plot about an amnesiac, possibly brain-damaged silent protagonist (seriously, this woman has fallen so many times—how is she alive?) who wakes up in a decayed testing facility and immediately starts taking orders from a talking British eyeball. Said eyeball, despite being adorable and an absolute idiot, somehow sets off a chain of events that reawakens GLaDOS, the most passive-aggressive murder machine in history.

GLaDOS, being the forgiving and reasonable AI that she is, immediately decides to continue science by throwing Chell back into test chambers because, well, what else is she supposed to do? This goes on for a while until, for reasons I can’t quite recall (probably because Wheatley had a great idea), we end up in the backrooms of Aperture Science, where we discover that A) Cave Johnson had no business running a company, B) Caroline is GLaDOS, and C) we were never meant to be here, yet here we are. Meanwhile, the last few remaining human test subjects, who were miraculously still alive, are casually killed off-screen by GLaDOS, who treats it as nothing more than taking out the trash.

Then Wheatley, in a stunning display of zero thought, overthrows GLaDOS, turns evil for like… a few hours, and then tries to kill Chell by designing some of the worst test chambers imaginable (to be fair, the man was not programmed for this). GLaDOS, now a potato (yes, really), helps Chell take him down, and the whole thing ends with the most polite attempted murder I’ve ever seen as Wheatley is hurled into space while regretfully apologizing. The game then unceremoniously boots Chell out of Aperture Science forever—because after everything, they really just wanted her gone.

One of the best additions was the cooperative multiplayer mode. Playing as Atlas and P-Body, two testing robots, you and a friend had to solve puzzles that required teamwork and communication. The co-op campaign was filled with clever, sometimes brain-melting challenges that emphasized trust and coordination, making it one of the best cooperative experiences in gaming.

The soundtrack was subtle yet effective, creating an immersive atmosphere that shifted from eerie to energetic depending on the situation. The dynamic music that responded to player actions made solving puzzles even more satisfying. And, of course, the game gave us yet another unforgettable ending song—""Want You Gone,"" a perfect follow-up to Still Alive.

Despite being released in 2011, Portal 2 remains as fun and engaging as ever. The gameplay is timeless, the humor still hits, and the community-created test chambers add infinite replayability. Few games manage to balance story, gameplay, and innovation as effortlessly as Portal 2 does.

If you’ve never played Portal 2, you’re missing out on one of the most brilliant games ever made. It’s an experience that blends humor, challenge, and storytelling in a way that few games have ever achieved. Whether you’re solving puzzles solo, laughing at Wheatley’s antics, or working through co-op challenges with a friend, Portal 2 is an unforgettable ride from start to finish.

2/10 A perfect game that every gamer should experience at least once.",False
620,"Portal 2 will always be in my opinion Valve's best work right next to Half Life 2 the visuals, story, and overall gameplay it nails every aspect of it.",True
620,"S-tier, one of it's kinda game. I thank valve for adding native linux support to all their games. It ran perfectly on my system. 

There is a certain charm to the game. Maybe it's the ""goofy [spoiler] Wheatley [/spoiler] and the snarky GlaDos"" or the cute turrets or the amazing puzzles. 
The voice actors and dialogue/story writers did a marvellous job. They made the player feel that the robots are alive and gave an amazing personality to each of the characters. The level designers also did a great job at creating complex puzzles with a handful of mechanics. For some experienced players they might feel a bit too easy but I am sure that the Co-op and community made levels will satisfy their hunger for really hard brain challenging levels.

I have not played the Co-Op yet but I am looking forward to playing them as soon as possible. The game also has countless mods, if you are looking forward to buying this game I would like to suggest you to check out the Portal mods on steam after finishing the game if you would like to have MORE Portal!
Have a good day <3.",True
620,"A classic Valve puzzle game with both a single player and a 2 player coop campaign. And it manages to include top-notch voice acting and a genuinely compelling story. It's excellent and barely costs anything ; it really puts in perspective how the modern gaming industry has fallen off a cliff in recent years. 

Everyone should experience this piece of video game history. 9/10",True
620,"Do you like puzzle solving games (for some reason) ? Also do you like games with lore and story? Portal 2 is just these and oh boy has valve done a great job making it enjoyable... I loved every part about this game (except from some, puzzles) and it's just so satisfying solving every puzzle. The v.a. is just great and the lore is interesting. Almost 10 hours in to it and I can see why people loved it. A valve classic. 

Also I was blown away by the details and quality of the game. 100% recommend it!!!",True
620,"one of my top 5 best games i've ever played, the lore is good its a great sequel and great mods. good game :)",True
620,"It’s an extremely good game, very entertaining even though it might seem simple. My favorite part is listening to GLaDOS talk, and every level is even better than the last. The story is well set, and the graphics are incredible. Without a doubt, it’s an excellent game.",True
620,I probably screwed up when i decided to play the co-op first instead of the story but i digress. As im making this review i havent finished the story but im sure its good,True
620,"Here at Aperture Science we believe in unique mechanics, amazing storytelling, and top notch graphics. Portal 2 was and still is a very good game. It's easily one of the more replayable games out there. Thanks to the boys up in research development, there's always something you didn't notice before, or a way to solve a test that was different from the last time. Not only is the main story great, but the multiplayer Co-Op mode is loads of fun. Then there's the addition of community test chambers. There are so many great chambers out there, some even with their own custom story lines! Crowd Sourcing chambers was definitely the right direction! The game basically never ends! It's only over when your brain is fried from solving puzzles! Good one Caroline! All in all it's amazing game that will keep you engaged, and our investors happy. So get to testing, before I put you fighting the humanoid praying mantis horde! Cave Johnson out!",True

620,"🚀 9/10 - Would solve mind-bending puzzles again! 🚀

Portal 2 is, without a doubt, one of the greatest games ever made. Valve took the innovative mechanics of the original Portal and expanded them into a full-fledged, unforgettable experience filled with ingenious puzzles, top-tier storytelling, and dark humor that never gets old.

🧩 Brilliant Puzzle Design: The portal gun is back, and with new mechanics like gels, light bridges, and excursion funnels, every chamber feels fresh and rewarding. The game does an incredible job of gradually introducing new elements while keeping the challenge engaging.

🎭 Unmatched Writing & Voice Acting: GLaDOS returns with her signature sarcastic wit, but the new characters—especially Wheatley (voiced by Stephen Merchant) and Cave Johnson (J.K. Simmons)—steal the show with hilarious, yet compelling dialogue. The storytelling is immersive, and the plot twists are genuinely jaw-dropping.

🎮 Co-op Mode = Pure Fun: The cooperative mode is a masterpiece in itself. Solving puzzles with a friend while laughing at their inevitable portal mishaps is an experience like no other. The teamwork and communication required make for some of the best multiplayer moments in gaming.

🏆 A Must-Play for Everyone: Whether you love puzzle games, rich storytelling, or just experiencing a game with some of the best writing in history, Portal 2 is an absolute must-play. Even after all these years, it remains a gold standard for game design.

💙 Final Verdict: A flawless blend of humor, intelligence, and innovation. If you haven't played it yet, stop reading and play it NOW! 🚀🔵🟠

✅ Score: 9/10 - A True Classic!",True

620,"This game, like many source games is still fantastic. I might even consider this to be one of the best Source games of all time, maybe even one of the best games of all time. It wont scratch everyone's itch, especially people who find these puzzles a bit too easy- but it still works as a light brain teaser. The amount of characterization Valve has worked on for every cast-member minor and major is fantastic.",True
620,"A sequel to the first portal game. It has both solo campaign and a co-op mode. Portal itself is a classic and a pretty great game overall that might scratch your brain a little every now and then. If you are still debating on whether to get this game or no, just wait till a steam sale when valve bundle goes on sale and you get so many good games out of it.",True

",True
620,"If you love solving puzzles you will love the game. If you come here to experience a single player story like me you will be disappointed.

The good:

Puzzle heaven, as the story progresses the game keeps adding new mechanics and gimmicks and things that interact with your portals to keep your mind engaged and add more challenge and variety to the tests.

Superb voice acting with witty dialogues full of passive aggressive jabs, unhinged company guidelines and macabre humor.

The same witty dialogues offer -some- exposition lore about the views and unethical experiments performed by the company Aperture, the unhinged and evil deeds of which can compete with the Vault-tech company of Fallout.

There is a co-op mode for friends to play together.

There is a level creator where you can build your own test chambers, and you can pick from a list and play test rooms created by other players.

Short chapters/test chambers with a good distribution of checkpoints locking in when you achieve a sub goal that will contribute to solving the main puzzle, so you don’t have to repeat the tests from the beginning if you mess up, accidentally jump to your death or die to a trap.

The Bad:

My main complaint is that the game focuses solely on the puzzle solving aspect and nothing else to the point it becomes detrimental to immersion and the story experience.

There is not enough lore to uncover, with only a specific chapter where you listen to prerecorded messages actually delivering a satisfying dose of lore and contributing to the world-building of the game.

Not enough secrets and interesting things to discover/interact with. I often found myself deviating from the correct path to explore a side room in hopes of discovering: a note, a memo, an old abandoned experiment set piece that was set aside, dead test subjects, other environmental story telling, or an extra quote from my robot companions making a new observation or offering me extra insight into their perspective as I enter an optional area. In most cases I found plain dead ends and empty rooms, generic set pieces of furniture I couldn’t interact with and vast empty fields cut off from the player by a broken bridge or chaircase. I found 3? secret rooms containing an abstract graffiti on them with no explanation about it and a few coffee mugs and that was it. Not even a comment from my companions and ai overlord about the graffity.

The short testing chambers that might be a plus for some, also means an endless amount of loading screens between the puzzles and sparse dialogues, something that further slows down the slugging and borderline non-existent plot progression to a standstill and breaks immersion.

In my opinion the puzzles on the later part become tedious rather than engaging, focusing on getting the right timing and quick reaction rather than critical thinking and outsmarting the test creator.

/ So, buy it if you love to solve environmental puzzles, but not if you are here to experience a story and are here for the story.
",True
620,"This game is so good. If you played or just finished portal 1 you gotta buy this, its funny, funny, and uhmm... 
potatoes. Although some of the puzzles are kinda difficult for me and I had to look up guides because i'm an idiot and there was 2 bugs a crossed by, one being the portal gun disappearing and the other being me not being able to exit the level, but those were fixed. When life gives you lemons, do uhhm, whatever you want with the lemons, I don't know.",True
620,"Spent $3 on this game (when it was on sale), did not regret it. I've never laughed my ass off so hard. With this game you can also download free mods online (because it's open source) to play fanmade sequels/prequels. Also, the map creator is great. You can play so many custom made maps by others, most of which are mind-bending high quality puzzles. Also bought portal 1 as soon as I finished portal 2 and for the same price recieved multiple half life games + chat access to tf2. This is the highest rated game on steam for a reason. They did not ruin the franchise by making portal 3, 4, 5 etc. They are the least greedy developers I've seen. They only care about earning enough money for making another high-quality projects. Good job Valve, you never disappoint.",True
620,"The greatest puzzle-story game ever made. Not too difficult, satisfying to figure out and piece together, crazy and perfectly comedic story, plenty of backstory and secrets to find without feeling like there's an overload of secrets. It's not the original Portal, because it does what a sequel is supposed to do, expand the world and give new content to the characters (only 2 from the first game so pretty easy there). Must play for anyone who likes games, would highly recommend playing the first game first if you can.",True
620,"10/10 even thirteen years later. It feels just as good as doing science should, which is to say extremely. A must play if you like puzzles, cancer, or being told to kindly kill yourself.",True
620,"Lived up to the hype! I normally do not enjoy puzzle games but this was so much more than that. I loved the humor, the level design was well done, no level was overly complicated to the point of frustration. Overall a fun experience with a much better story than I ever would have imagined.",True
620,"This game is not as good as portal but almost as good. I like how it is more story oriented and we learn about the world of apature and it showcases how valve excels at turning games with cool settings and simple storys and improves those stories in its sequels but like half life, the first is always better but valve makes amazing sequels.I love the start of this game but it gets boring after you leave the lab and gets a lot better when wheatley takes over the lab, its quirky and fun and I love playing with glados on the portal gun  4.5/5",True
620,this game is super fun but is hard if you don't know how to play but it will walk you through it like portal 1 just play portal 1 first,True

both the story and creative gameplay are on point",True

10/10",True
620,"Probably my favorite game of all time. Ever since I was a kid I've always been enamored with this game, it's world and it's story. Valve is so good at just making perfect games. Something about the portal gun, the facility, GLaDOS and all of the other robots is just so cool. Also I love puzzles.

Love this game to death, Thank you Valve.",True
620,really really good game i would recommond it to every single soul walking this earth (but play portal 1 first tho),True
620,"Beautiful sequel! It does not try to amp up the themes that were already masterfully developed in Portal. Instead it provides a flourishing variety of graphical styles and new gameplay that play homage to the first installment while providing a lot of fun and entertainment to the player. While the first game is dark and builds upon the oppressive feeling of loneliness and uncertainty, here you have talkative companions and you feel part of a story with a finale that is more and more anticipated. There is a fantastic comic relief in Wheatley and some psychological introspection about human nature with Glados/Caroline. Moreover the development of the character of Cave Johnson through the recordings and the framed portraits is subtle and remarkable. And the evolution of graphics and technology through the decades as you explore the old labs is really aesthetically pleasing. So in conclusion, really, really recommended game, brilliant and entertaining - just not as iconic, focused, and touching as the first one, which is a masterpiece.",True
620,"Main game is much more expansive and generally better than the first game and introduces multiple new mechanics that are all fun. The puzzles (especially those toward the end of the game) feel really rewarding to complete as they're much more complicated than the portal 1 chambers. 
The coop mode is also fun if you like solving puzzles with a friend. The chambers in coop mode are very well designed and are fun for both players :)",True
620,"This game was great! ton of content for like a dollar when its on sale, the story's great, really interesting gameplay mechanics. The puzzles had me feeling thinky but not so much that I was lost, (except for the time during the part where he kills you where he crushes the catwalk and I was stuck on there for like 15 minutes and had to look up a walkthrough video where I found out there was a portalable wall in the doorway like 2 feet behind me) and the voice acting's phenomenal. Also, somehow this game still looks amazing after like 14 years? Can't recommend it enough. get both games, play them both, get ""still alive"" stuck in your head for like 3 weeks, (not in this game but still relevant) yeah, just have a blast and remember to think with portals.

(btw i dont have 55 hours in this game i just left it running paused in the background for like 2 days lol)",True

Funny characters

CONS:
Really hard

620,"portal 2 is a cool problem solving puzzle game where portals are the main mechanic. It has a lot of improvements from the first one, like the longer storyline, more character depth and more lore. Overall, Portal 2 is a genuine 8/10 and I recommend it to anyone looking for a fun but also hard puzzle game",True
620,"Portal 2 takes everything that made the original Portal amazing and expands it with more puzzles, new mechanics, and a hilarious narrative. Join Chell as she journeys through Aperture Science, this time with the help (and occasional sabotage) from quirky characters like Wheatley and GLaDOS.

620,Great puzzle game with some interesting ideas. My main complaint with some of the exploration levels is that it usually felt like hunting for the few spots you could turn into a portal. The self-contained puzzle rooms were usually quite good though.,True
620,"Portal 2 is basically the 2014 film Whiplash, and that's not because JK Simmons is in this game and that movie.  No Whiplash was first an Indie short film released the previous year, when it blew up the full length movie was filmed.  Portal is the same.  The original Portal is fantastic but its short like an indie film and leaves you wanting more.  Portal 2 is that full length movie with the same cast, same beats, and just knocks it out of the park to become a cult classic.  Although, my analogy falls kind of flat cause Portal 2 is not the same story as the first one, its a sequel so go play Portal 1 first then come back here.",True
620,"snappy dialogue, excellent story, great mechanics,",True
620,This game has some of the best storytelling I have ever seen in a game and I think it was the best $10 I've ever spent but you should get the first game first because you need it to understand the story because you play as the same character.,True
620,"Single Player; Amazing puzzle game with a funny and epic story

Multiplayer; depends on how patient you are with your friends, but if youre willing to look at them run into a wall for 20 minutes then this is it. amazing coop game idk",True
620,"Portal 2 is a game that definitely lives up to its expectations. Albeit a bit pricey, the puzzles are very fun, the plot is really intense and funny, and just the amount of things you get to experience are fascinating.

+ Puzzles are well built in a way where I never ended up getting stuck because of something that later was just stupid, instead, the only times i got stuck where when i was being an idiot. A few times id spent a good 15 minutes looking around like ""WHAT DO I DO"" just to realize, ""i couldve just put a portal on the floor"" and laugh it off. Other times it felt like I spotted a really difficult to see part of the puzzles where i thought i accidentally broke the game, just to find out that was exactly it, and it was built in a way to subtly draw attention to that wall or item.

+ I was only able to cheese 1 puzzle, which says a lot cus most puzzles games can be really easy to cheese.

+ Wheatly is funny

+ the really advanced plot felt like a movie.

Theres not much else to say that hasnt already been said, this is one of the highest rated games on steam, and rightfully so.",True
620,"Worth every penny.
If you watch an anime like Paprika, this will feel like a sci-fi adaptation of it.
It sprinkles subtle reminiscences from both Fallout and Half-Life into it, while keeping it inquisitive, comedic and mind-bending.",True
620,fun good but if you have no friends you cant play multiplayer and you cant get everything,True
620,"One of the best games ever. The mechanics are solid the quality and graphics hold up, even if it's because there's no weird human models. The gameplay is also always great to repeat be it for speedrunning or finding easter eggs you missed in the first playthrough. 

Also J. K. Simmons.",True
620,"Very fun game, my only gripe is that the illumination is kind very dark in my opinion, other than that, solid puzzle game, fun dialog and lots of comunity content",True
620,"Portal 2 still has great puzzles, and it still has snarky and passive-aggressive AIs delivering hilarious monologues. The co-op mode is a welcome addition and well worth playing with a friend. There are more humorous monologues; unfortunately, the game sometimes expects you to stop what you're doing stay put to listen to them, to the detriment of the game's pacing.",True
620,THIS GAME IS SO SO GOOD. I love both co-op and single player the puzzels are not very difficult but they are still very fun and satisfying to solve!,True
620,"Portal 2 is so fun, it's got good puzzles, the character's and their lines are memorable and silly. What makes it even better is that it's CHEAP!!! I don't even like puzzle games, but Portal is just so unique. And with that I think it's time you should offer up your cash and have a good time!",True

Nice story and not too hard with lots of additional content and multiplayer.

Really worth a try.",True
620,"Portal 2 is great game, took me 12 hours to complete in solo and 8 in co-op. The physics feels kinda weird, maybe because i got used to first game. Its sad that I can't spawn air boat the same as in the first portal.",True
620,puzzles are somehow extremely hard and simple at the same time and caused a spiral into insanity. Fully recommend playing especially with friends in the co op mode.,True
620,Probably the best puzzle game. The only nitpick i have is in the main campain its a bit hard to know where you can and can't place portals.,True
620,"Was surprised that it took me three hours more than the first to complete, but the time flew by and this felt even shorter. A perfect sequel!",True
620,good game but some puzzles are hard and wheatley is a moron.definetly recommend it,True
620,"Portal 2 is an experience i think every gamer should have, i'm yet to see a game who picks the theme and a gameplay style from a previous and translate it so perfectly into a much bigger experience, further expanding the lore, world and creative potential. All in a light experience where you can have a lot of fun without trying too hard. It kinda even feels like the pure organic growth of portal, and not a different product.
10/10",True
620,"I played this in 2025 and I must applaud it. What a work of art here! It did not make me cry - only a few games managed to get to that level - but I am getting goosebumps for many minutes straight. What an experience.

Challenges progress perfectly and surprises are put just in the right moment so you are never bored. The dialogs are genial and the plot is just awesome. The ending is great and emotional.

Valve's just outstanding!",True

Extends the gameplay and story of the first, the only reason is does not eclipse the first is that it's length does not allow it the same kind of impact that the first did.",True
620,Portal 2 multiplayer is and will forever be one of the most fun things to come back to every few years. Campaign is solid too.,True

great story telling with amazing game machanics.
i havent played portal 1 btw and i was still able to enjoy it.
10/10",True
620,"Everything that made the first Portal great is completely fleshed out and written to perfection in the sequel. I beat it many moons ago but the impact it left on me has reverberated in mass waves across my gaming identity. Portal 2 sprawls into such strange, but evocative settings and story lines that probes wonder at what an artificial intelligence-ruled corporation could spell out for humanity's future. Some puzzles do require walkthroughs imo, and it offers less linearity compared to Portal 1. However, the characterization and ending far surpass Portal 1 and the execution of this classic title is unparalleled.",True

620,"Despite being 14 years old, Portal 2 remains a timeless classic. If you haven't played it, you haven't experienced true PC gaming. GLaDOS's voice alone is worth buying the game. Her passive-aggressive commentary and thinly veiled threats are a masterclass in robotic snark. The puzzles are pretty good and difficult. Just try not to inhale too deeply. You might find yourself enjoying the neurotoxin a little too much.",True

I had to go to the portal 2 section of the Flatscreen to VR discord and I found the information there.  I would recommend this game flat or in VR.  It is a fun little physics puzzle game that has a humorous story",True

620,"Portal 2 is genuinely one of my favorite PC games! The co-op is fantastic and I really appreciate the built-in controller support! (Especially since this game sucks with a trackpad). The low system requirements mean I was able to run this on my 2016 ThinkPad! The puzzles are genuinely hard! I may suck at Portal 2, but I still love this game! You can't even say this review is nostalgia, as I only bought this game in December. No this review probably isn't fair, as I have not yet made it past the 7th stage to feature turrets, but I can say that so far, this game is PHENOMENAL!",True

I haven't really tried portal 1 yet but i'm sure its great too but for now portal 2 is probably one of my favorite games on steam.",True

620,very fun a and cool game. i also really like the coop mode. really fun whit a friend,True
620,"An essential video game. I say this with all my heart: Portal 2 is one of the best video games ever made. The puzzles are challenging but never frustrating. The visuals, the sounds, the writing, it is top notch. The game is designed in such a way that you feel yourself grow and acquire skills overtime. The co-op mode is just as good as the main story. Anyone who has a Steam account should own this.",True
620,"[b]🏆 Overall rating: 9.5/10[/b]
You should play Portal before playing Portal 2 to get the best experience. The game inherits the good aspects of part 1 and develops very well in part 2. The story is really good, but I am more impressed with the coop and community mods.
You must play this game at least once.
[b]You only really play once.[/b]",True
620,"8.5/10 
i never a puzzle game to be so fun and funny

-the pacing of the game is amazing 
-the puzzles also never felt the same because they were always changing
-there was always something new on every chamber
-the graphics are also pretty good in my opinion
-the framerate is also fantastic the game was always super smooth even when the whole world was crashing 
down
-the comedy is great and was never unfunny
-great ending with great characters
-they were also very good with big open spaces

portal 2 is in short a puzzle game with very unique mechanics, great story with great characters, constant new mechanics and features even at the last chapters, you wil never feel bored playing this game and because of that i would highly recommend it and it is super cheap so you really dont have a reason not to play it.

highly recommend :)",True
620,Great game I have finally completed the main game and now im going to play co-op.,True
620,The game is very good! The plot and atmosphere are one of the best.,True
620,"This game is just a masterpiece, like what can I even say? From the story, gameplay and music. I can't find many downsides to this game either, maybe some puzzles were too hard, but that just depends on your skill and intelligence, the story is one of the best I've ever seen or heard, it quickly starts off with action, then plot twists happen here and there, the game slows down a bit after that, but it introduces new fun mechanics, the game then slowly gets back into action and the ending... 

It's just, very lovely, playing this game will make you connect with the characters in game, and that whats make the story so good. Again, if you haven't played this game, please give it a try, maybe stay away from it if you don't like puzzle games but, the story makes up for it and you can always try the free demo in the first Portal game.

And for me, I'm GLAD I found this game and decided to give it a try.

Because it is just THAT GOOD. Ok but seriously,  go play Portal 2, it will Change your LIFE.",True
620,"so much community content! endless fun. and even before that, the game was already worth playing. game was worth it just for more of the portal 1 experience, and then there's even so much story content on top of that. great new mechanics, challenging puzzles, marvelous expansion of the storyline, and endless hours of community created puzzles. awesome release, still holds up today.",True
620,"This has got to be one of the best puzzle games I've ever played! The writing is hilarious and the puzzles are the perfect amount of challenging. Portal 2 has got to be the most perfect sequel to a game ever made- or at least very close to it!

Most puzzle games become quite frustrating when you get stuck on a puzzle for a long time but for whatever reason, portal seems to keep me engaged the entire time. The level design is masterful and makes use of the physics-based mechanics extremely well. The characters are memorable and interesting, which also applies to the world building. Even the music in the game is beautifully crafted to fit the nature of the game perfectly

Portal is a game series that I think everyone in the world should play at least once in their life! If you haven't played this series yet, stop whatever you're doing and play it right now!",True
620,Such a fun game to replay every few months after everything slightly fades in my memory.,True
620,Still one of the greatest games of all time. Let's just hope Valve can learn how to count.,True

It's fun, funny, got a great story and interesting lore and characters.  Good voice acting, looks great considering it's more than a decade old, and on top of all of that, anybody can play this game.  When other games are recommended, they still have to appeal to that person's interest.

Would recommend

",True
620,"Portal 2 is the game that got me to create a Steam account in the first place. I never was much of a fan of first person shooting games but with Portal, the emphasis was on puzzles and the shooting was ... well, portals. It was a great way to feel the gameplay of a genre I largely ignored. Once I realized there was a delightful story with hilarious dialogue, I was hooked. I had to go back and play the first game as well. I decided to start a new playthrough tonight as a friend and I have been playing the co-op mode on Switch recently.

Portal 2 is quirky fun that you have to experience. Once you've played the single-player game, you'll likely have fun with the two-player challenges as well. The only sad part is you're not going to get the wonderful story of the single-player experience. However, the two testing robots that you control are filled with personality. I often think of them as Bert and Ernie due to their size and shapes.

I'm rambling incoherently now. Clearly this is a poorly formed review. (But what do you expect from someone that just found out they've experienced brain damage?! Hee hee.)",True
620,"Portal 2 is a must grab on sale if you don't have it already, I played it for the first time when it came out for a few hours but I was fairly young and didn't have the bandwidth to finish the campaign. Came back to it recently 12 years later to try co-op and I'm having a blast. Don't get me wrong, the single player campaign is great and much more complex than multiplayer when it comes to the story and puzzles, but Portal feels like a series that plays best with a friend imo now that I've tried both.",True
620,"I love the game but its no longer running on my mac
so sadly i cannot play it anymore and recommend it
the game keeps getting updates but still not updated to the new macOs system
even though it still shows the mac symbol next to the game
so if you have mac i wouldn't recommend buying it.
very sad!

620,"This game is the BEST best and coolest puzzle game I ever played, the story line is geniuatly very intresting. Every challenge makes it fell unique, There obviously is some challenges that make my brain hurt, but I DEFINITLY  would recomend this game",True
620,"For someone who isn’t huge into solely puzzle focused games, this was a blast! The puzzles have a good level of progression, with it never being too stressful. The simple art design and level layout ensure you have everything you need to solve the puzzle laid out in front of you, it’s purely down to you to use what you’ve learned and connect the abstract dots via the portal gun.

This time around the story to gameplay balance was perfect, whereas the first feels a little more like a pilot episode for this game. Loved the voice acting, witty writing and pacing, and absolutely nailed the ending for me which could have been easy to mess up.

Even though I could only play the game in small bursts, I loved every second of it. A truly immersive, enjoyable and innovative game that I’d recommend to anyone who hasn’t yet played it.

Here’s to hoping for Portal 3 🍻",True
620,"This is very cool game and it helps my brain be better, cus it sucks. The puzzles are hard but fun and i think everybody should have this game.",True
620,"The basic game is great, and the user-made test chambers add endless additional content. It's more serious than kiddie games, but doesn't have the violent content of most FPS games. The best part of the original game are the humor, story, and variety; many of the the user-made chambers are challenging puzzles that really make you think.",True
620,"Hi there, I see you. reading through the comments. yeah the game is good and a solid follow up from the classic. But how are you doing today? I hope things are looking up from last week. Keep your head up and enjoy a good game. 

And stay away from ferrets for the next 2 weeks, just to be safe.",True
620,"Love that game! It's longer than the first one, smarter, adds new mechanics, has great voice acting - and more than in the first one!
I love the ambiances that they created with this one: laboratory, post-apocalyptic , even some backroom vibes at times. Graphics and audio work together for a great immersion.

620,"11/10. 
That's it. 

It is one of the best if not the best puzzle game ever made. The way that it incorporates physics, technical game play, amazing characters, and an amazing story makes you feel emotions that you have never felt before. VALVe really showed us what its like to create perfect games with Half Life, Half Life 2, Portal and Portal 2. As long as your brain hasn't been rotted by the typical FPS game, you should see this game as a masterpiece. It is just you and a couple robots throughout the game yet through extremely detailed dialogue with sarcasm and humor, you feel as though you are talking to actual people. The music and easter eggs also add a special amount of immersion that other games do not provide. 10/10 recommend.",True
620,"Fun game, great story and ending, but a lot of achievements are locked behind the co-op gamemode, so I can't 100% it because I have no friends.",True
620,"An epic puzzle game with a good graphics , good thinking and good story. so why not.",True
620,"It's Portal 2, this is one of many staples of gaming from Valve
Just play everything in the Orange Box trust",True
620,"Well, here we are again.

Portal 2 definitely doesn’t stray far from the original games feel, yet it has a lot of new features and differences to make the experience feel fresh. The main campaign takes around 8 to 10 hours to complete and the puzzles are even more difficult then the last game. Beware that there are some references to the original and probably will be confusing to newer players of the series, so I kind of recommend you play that first.

Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone that has played the first portal or had access to it on steam.",True
620,"Fun CO-OP experience and an even better campaign, one of the best reviewed games on steam for a reason, get it on sale and enjoy ~10 hours of peak puzzle gameplay alone and with a friend!",True

Rating: 10/10",True
620,"After all these years, still one the best puzzle solving games out there. Some of the levels do get frustrating though.",True
620,"really good game, very fun to play, either alone, or with friends, even though the steam remote play together feature could use some polish, but that's not portal 2's fault

great game for thinking with portals, definitely got surprised with not more of the same, but more of the new

10/10, would play it again",True
620,"This is by far my favorite PC game. Great graphics, co-op, story line and to top it off, anyone can create a level meaning there is endless game play. I highly recommend this!",True
620,"I find portal 2 very fun. I realy like the story and how it follows up to the original game. Other than the story i love the replayability added in portal 2. By that i mean the map making and the ability to play community maps, not to mention coop. Overall its a fun game with plenty of content.",True
620,Really fun but you would need to of played the first one to understand most of it how ever really good game play and story highly recommend,True
620,"I knew Valve make some of the best games in the industry, but I did not expect a puzzle game from 2011 would hit this hard. The puzzles are extremely well-designed, so much so that solving them feels like watching your team winning last minute at a football match. The bots have more personalities than most modern RPG companions they expect you to fall in love with. And the chasing episodes are on par with some of the best action-adventure games I have played. To think I bought it with less than one USD feels practically unreal. 10/10",True
620,Amazing two player co-op game with really fun puzzles that utilise the game's mechanics extremely well.,True
620,very nice story and good puzzles. not sure about multiplayer yet. but i am mad there was no cake >:(,True

620,"This is a really nice game and it has good puzzles. I really recommend this game!

",True
620,"I was NOT expecting to love this game as much as I did. I'm a person who gets seriously stressed out when confronted with something I can't figure out, so puzzle games are usually a pass for me. However, this game had intuitive puzzle design that at times felt overwhelming, but when picked apart was really quite simple for the most part. I will say however that the test chambers were quite repetitive, and the segments outside of chambers were the parts that I enjoyed the most. It also felt like the game dragged on a little bit, but 4-5 hours really isn't terrible. I loved the character design and how each one was somewhat lovable/understandable in their own way (even though there were only 3 characters if you count the defects as 1 character). I feel like the game was somewhat lacking in protagonist character design, though, because it really just felt like our character was a vessel for the story to progress, when we should have been an interlocking part. I guess the game leaves it up to the player to be the protagonist's personality? Anyway, final sequence was clever and also somewhat heartwarming. I just love when games go and make their own lyrical soundtracks, it makes everything so much more cinematic (just take a look at Mirror's Edge!). Anyway, all in all pretty fun game and a story that actually wasn't too bad. (Also, the part where he kills you did get a pretty good laugh out of me :))",True
620,"Portal 2 is genuinely one of my favorite puzzle games of all time. Each chamber has just the right amount of difficulty that if you aren't that great at pattern recognition you can still beat the level but not too easy to where beating it doesn't feel like an accomplishment. Not only that but the puzzle also have multiple ways of beating them most of the time so if you can't figure out a puzzle one way you can also look at it from a different angle. Not only that but the story is deep, but not hard to follow. This game is genuinely the perfect balance of everything you'd want in a game",True
620,"i basically have the same thoughts on this game as portal 1. buy it. also there is a level editor in this game but barely anyone uses it, for some reason.",True
620,"Been playing this with my fortnite duo buddy and we are having a lot of fun with it. It's challenging, Gladis (sp?) provides some clever sarcasm that makes even the most frustrating map a little funnier. Definitely recommend. For a game that's over a decade old, it still is a lot of fun. :)",True
620,"Sometimes while playing this game, I just have the primal urge to reach inside of my pants and start jacking off. The sound the portal gun makes is so deliciously juicy, every time I hear it, it reaches me closer to my climax until I finally extrude my ""Conversion Gel"" all over my screen. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this, and I hope to find others alike me on my never ending endeavor.",True
620,"A sequel to a perfect game that is itself nearly perfect. My only criticism is that the story could've been tightened up a bit in the middle. But you get Cave Johnson, GlaDOS in a potato, and the Best. Ending. Ever.",True
620,It's a very good sequel for its first game. The CO-OP mode is also fun to play with friends.,True

",True
620,"timeless. genius. funny.

Giving the players more and more reasons to play and rreplay. Alone or with company. Whether playing the campaign or community maps, the feeling when a puzzle is solved, is pure bliss.
Although, the lore and story feel incompete, thats only because we want more.",True
620,"This game is legitimately one of the best games I've ever played. Despite being 14 years old, it still holds up to (and honestly surpasses) modern puzzle games.",True
620,Great 1st person game where you need to look for clues and be clever in getting around and solving obstacles. Many objectives are easier than they look as long as you got the nogan' to solve them. The problem solving and great story telling make this a must have for any gamer.,True
620,"ya gotta play it, it has a bunch of good stuff:
- nice story
- bri'ish robot
- co-op with ball robot and egg robot
- lots of test chambers with the workshop + free test chamber creator in game
- one of the better vgui based guis (had to say it vro)
- epik musik
- nice environments
- bonus points for being a valve game

620,"portal 2 will always have a special place in my heart, this game is so intricate with its story going from being stuck miles under ground, viewing the history of aperture science with 2 intelligent robots, to being released back to the world above after regaining control of the facility. 100/10 for even being such a short game in my opinion",True
620,"One of my absolute favorite games of all time. The dialogue is perfect, the rooms are decently challenging, the world building is great, the music and how it interacts with the environment is excellent, and an awesome story.

620,played it on the ps3 years ago and yep it still holds up great i love it to death,True
620,"One of the greatest video games of all time, full stop. Fantastically fun puzzles, super memorable characters, and a very distinctive aesthetic that you can feel in every part of the game. Would be the easiest recommendation of my life even without co-op levels and community chambers. It's Portal 2, and I think by now it kind of speaks for itself.",True
620,"Real fun so far , i like the jokes GLaDOS makes its just very fun overall , took me some time in a few levels but the satisifaction after completing that level is just unmatched . Although i do feel nauseous after playing it for a while but that could be because of extreme movement in the game and like th gravity shift and all idk , anyways Its a fun game",True

620,"As a totally inexperienced gamer, I like the way skill with the controller isn't everything and solving puzzles is 99% of the game.  The backgrounds and sets are fantastic and the puzzles are often challenging.  There are one or two areas where you can just wander about lost for a while but they way is easy enough if you follow obvious clues. There is also a story line and a companion and achievements to find, adding to the interest.  It overcomes problems I had with Portal 1, where I just  couldn't get past certain points because of lack of controller skill.  It's the only game I really like.",True
620,"I love this game. After all these years, playing it feels like the first time. Portal 2 is truly unique in its co-op mode, and the community maps are a form of art in their own right.",True
620,i enjoy the story and puzzles this game is wonder but why is it 1$ it dose not make sence but good game best 1$ spent,True
620,One of the most story rich an lore filled games ever. Great gameplay with challenging puzzles and a lot of multiplayer maps.,True
620,Me and the Bros just sending each other across the room for funsies. Its quite a pleasant experience.,True
620,"Really fun game, good mix of puzzles and humour.
",True
620,"I'm going to be so honest, I come back to this and Portal 1 annually. It's because of how these games are just masterpieces in their own right, specifically Portal 2. Every puzzle you complete makes you want to do more, the story is very memorable to this day, the atmosphere and set pieces are magnificently gorgeous after a full decade of it being out. The influence this game has to so many other games being released today shows how much of a masterpiece this title just gives off.
The one negative thing I could ever say about this game, is the loading screens. There is WAYYY too many of them and you can tell it's because of the engine they're using or the limited space they have to work with for the time. But I honestly couldn't care all too much, because you'll get to love this game again and again and always want to play more.
Hell, this game even goes on sale for a $1 so there's not much to lose. There's not much I could even say that other reviews have already said, get the game so that you don't miss out on something amazing.",True

620,"Portal 2 is hands down the best puzzle game of all time. It took everything great about the original Portal, and cranked that up to 11. The environments, visuals, story, and puzzles all got a major upgrade. Being released in 2011, Portal 2 is a relic of an era when gaming companies actually made good games instead of just filling everything with battle passes and gatcha mechanics. Despite its age, however, it still holds up in 2025 and keeps me coming back for multiple playthroughs so I can hunt for secrets and achievements. It even has a level editor and online mode!",True
620,"I mean its Portal...  If you know anything about portal you know that $10 is a steal for what it is. It has great graphics for a game made in 2011. Not only that it has one of the best game play experiences of all time period and, It has one of the best video game plots of all time if not the best. Since this game is from 2011 it can run on practically any computer. Any ways this game is one of the if not the best game of all time.

Puzzles, and the feeling of putting Wheatly in charge really made me feel bad about GLaDOS. It's like ""Oh! Wheatly you should have been my partner in Portal 1!"" But later, then it's like ""My god Wheatly, why was I with you in the first place you little bi-""",True

I recommend, but only at full price. :)",True
620,"Portal 2's just great. In every way that Portal succeeded, Portal 2 does the same, almost, even, a tad better. Both multiplayer and story modes are genuinely incredible puzzle solving masterpieces that keep the sardonic, almost nihilistic, yet still humorous tone. The game isn't ""hard,"" per se, but it will likely take you a while to navigate some of the co-op rooms, unless you're just the best to ever do it, I guess. Short and sweet, I really can't fault this game on anything that isn't just the genre itself. Valve strikes a 10/10.",True

620,"Portal 2 – A Timeless Puzzle Masterpiece

Rating: ★★★★★ (10/10)

Valve’s Portal 2 is a game that sets the gold standard for puzzle-platformers. Building upon the innovative mechanics of its predecessor, this sequel delivers a masterful blend of challenging puzzles, dark humor, and an unforgettable story.

Gameplay & Mechanics
At its core, Portal 2 retains the iconic portal gun, allowing players to create interconnected portals to navigate mind-bending test chambers. The game introduces new elements like Excursion Funnels, Repulsion and Propulsion Gels, and Light Bridges, which expand puzzle complexity and variety. The difficulty progression is smooth, ensuring players feel challenged without frustration.

Story & Atmosphere
The game’s narrative is as engaging as its gameplay. You reprise the role of Chell, navigating the ruined Aperture Science facility, guided (and taunted) by the ever-sarcastic AI, GLaDOS. The introduction of Wheatley, a bumbling yet hilarious personality core, adds depth and comedy to the experience. The voice acting, especially from Stephen Merchant and Ellen McLain, is phenomenal.

Multiplayer & Replayability
Beyond the fantastic single-player campaign, the co-op mode introduces an entirely new experience. Playing as Atlas and P-Body, you and a friend must rely on teamwork and communication to solve intricate puzzles. The game also supports community-made test chambers, giving it nearly infinite replay value.

Graphics & Soundtrack
Despite being released in 2011, Portal 2 still holds up visually, thanks to its art direction and atmospheric lighting. The soundtrack, composed by Mike Morasky, perfectly complements the game’s sci-fi setting, enhancing both tension and excitement.

Verdict
Portal 2 is not just a game—it’s an experience. With its perfect blend of clever puzzles, immersive storytelling, and co-op fun, it remains one of the greatest games of all time. Whether you're a first-time player or returning for another round of testing, Aperture Science is always worth the visit.

Final Score: 10/10 – A must-play for puzzle and story lovers alike!

Coop is long and hard and will make you really think and i really mean it Single player is way easier thou soo dont worry!!

runs really good on a rx580 4gig at 1440p never really going under 90fps

overall 9/10",True
620,"This really isn't necessary at all since it's literally Portal 2, but yeah, this game is awesome.

I'm insanely late to the party, but I finally finished Portal 2, and it's as good as everyone says. Even now, in 2025, Portal 2 is one of if not arguably the best puzzle game of all time. Portal 1 is great in it's own right, but Portal 2 succeeds in every aspect at improving on it's predecessor. More mechanics, deeper puzzles, better characters, better story, better action, pretty much everything you could think of. 

The main thing to note about Portal 2 is that it is, in my opinion, a masterclass in video game design. While I noted that the game has more mechanics, they actually only added a few; the difference is that they are all of the utmost quality. It's really easy for sequels to get caught in the ""more"" trap and just go on a rampage of adding things for the sake of it, but the reason why it works in Portal 2 is that everything is added in the context of everything else. This is one of the best examples of ""less is more"" in gaming. Every mechanic is intuitive, fun, and incredibly simple in isolation. Adding everything together is what gets things really going. They have also mastered introducing new mechanics to the player. It typically goes like (show player what mechanic looks like -> allow player to test mechanic and figure out what it does -> force player to apply mechanic in a specific way -> way of using mechanic is added to their pool of knowledge -> add to that and make them combine everything in various ways to complete tests). It's incredibly rewarding and does a great job of easing you into each new trial.

As a side note, I already briefly mentioned it, but it's incredible how well Portal 2 holds up today. Granted it's not THAT old, but it's still impressive. I can only guess that it's Valve's excellent art direction that has allowed it to survive the seemingly exponential progression in graphics and technology in general. It's like Mirror's Edge or some of Valve's other games like TF2 in that respect. Portal 2 isn't trying to have cutting edge realistic graphics for what it would be in 2011, but it instead focuses on aesthetic, colour, and general art direction first. There isn't anything inherently wrong with trying to push your game into photo-realism, but if you want it to visually last, you need to take a page out of Valve's book.

Story wise, like I said, it's great as well. I went in blind, and the game felt like a real adventure all around. I enjoyed the characters, their arcs, the environments, the conclusion, all that good stuff. I don't really have much to say other than that, partly because I don't want to spoil anything, but also because it's just... good. Not life changing, but it's enjoyable from start to finish.

TL;DR: Portal 2 still holds up now and you should go play it.",True

Now were thinking with portals.",True
620,"Alright, so I finally caved and picked up Portal 2, and let me tell you, as a long-time WoW player, this is a whole different kind of addiction. I've never really been into puzzle games; always thought they were a bit dry. But Portal 2? It's got me hooked like a gnome in a fishing contest.

The humor in this game is gold. Wheatley, that little robot with the British accent, had me cracking up constantly. I don't know why a robot needs a British accent, but it just makes everything funnier. The story is surprisingly engaging, and the characters are well-developed. It's like a Pixar movie, but with more portals and less crying (though, I admit, I did feel a pang when I accidentally incinerated a Companion Cube).

The gameplay is something else. Figuring out how to manipulate the environment with the portals is incredibly satisfying. ""Speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out"" becomes your mantra as you're launching yourself across the levels. And just when you think you've got it figured out, they throw gels, lasers, and light bridges into the mix. It's a constant learning curve, but never frustrating.

I even got my sister to play the co-op mode with me, and it was a blast. Twice the portals means twice the brainpower, and let me tell you, we needed it. Solving those puzzles together was actually a bonding experience, which is more than I can say for most of our family game nights.

Honestly, Portal 2 is just a beautifully designed game. It makes you think outside the box[3], and it's funny as hell while doing it. If you haven't played it yet, do yourself a favor and pick it up. It's a steal, and it might just change the way you look at video games.",True

Not bad but the first game is much more my jam.",False
620,"Clearly a fantastic game, just not for me.
This game starts off amazingly, love the puzzles, love the lore, it’s a really funny game! Then the puzzles kinda lose me after the different gels are introduced. Because it becomes less how can I use portals to manipulate the environment and more, how can I use portals to spray gel everywhere then bounce around till I get to the exit. The plot is super interesting but I’m out of patience. I’m eight hours in, think I’m close too the end, gonna finish out the story on YouTube. Clearly a solid game, not my kinda fun anymore.",False

While the first portal's levels are more focused around the portal gun, portal 2's levels focuses on other unique gimmicks and how they interact with the portal gun. Some of these include the light bridge thingies, the propulsion, repulsion, and the conversion gels, and the excurscisong tunnel blue thing. All of these mechanics feel fresh and pair really well with the portal gun, adding a new layer of depth to portal 2's levels. Portal 2 also has a much deeper plot and better writing than the original portal, with the puzzles being more focused on story progression. The game explores the history and origins of Aperture science and introduces wheatly the Bri ish guy. Wheately is a really funny character because he is Bri ish an d he is really stupid. This game also has a co-op mode which I haven't played because I have no friends, so that is cool and different from the first game. In conclusion, this game heavily builds on what has already been established in the first game, and introduces new and interesting mechanics while polishing the old ones.

620,"[h1]Rating: 10/10 -Masterpiece[/h1]

[h1]TLDR:[/h1]
[b]A textbook example of how to make a sequel to an already great game.[/b]


If the first one blew you away...this is going to blow you up to the moon. It takes everything the first portal did and made it better and gave it a fresh coat of paint.


[h1]Positive:[/h1]

[b]Story and lore:[/b]
While the first one was stronger on the gameplay side, Portal 2 has alot more to offer on both story, lore and gameplay side. The game has a more fleshed out story about the history of aperture science and glados. You get to see behind the scenes of the enrichment center and uncover it's secrets that are hidden deep below the surface. Im not gonna say much more. Go play it. Now.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
The portal gun returns of course. So do the cube puzzles. There are lasers now which you can control with the portals and a cube that can redirect the laser. There are jump pads that let you fly through the air. Again, Im not gonna say much more since encountering those elements for the first time is part of the fun. If you think you've seen all kinds of elements portal could offer, you'd be dead wrong.

[b]Music:[/b]
Portal 1 had an eerie atmospheric soundtrack which fit the game perfectly. Portal 2 soundtrack is more varied. Not so atmospheric anymore. It uses a mixture of synths and orchestral instruments to create very good tracks. The music is not static. It reacts to the players actions. The song adds an element when you fly through the air for example. It sounds like science.


[h1]Negative:[/h1]

[b]None:[/b]
This game is flawless. There is nothing that should be added or removed.


[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]

The Portal series is an incredible piece of science fiction. Do we need a Portal 3? Yes of course. Even though, it felt like the story is kind of over with portal 2. There was no cliffhanger like in the Half-Life series. Portal for me is how video games are meant to be. You play it, you enjoy it, you maybe even play it again. No massive open world, no slop quests, no 100h story, no microtransactions or constant updates. Im tired of this. Just give me a finished game, let me play it and im good.",True

Besides that, it's also a hilarious, campy adventure to get out of a crazy dungeon. The voice acting absolutely superb (anyone that has seen TBBT might recognize Wheatly's voice). GlaDos is simply a gentle, angry bitch; all she wants to do is TEST! I think J. Jonah. Jameson makes an appearance. 

All in all, this is truly an amazing game. You can spend hundreds of hours enoying and/or hating it. Either way, you'll still love it. I first played it on Xbox, and once I saw it on Steam, the purchase was a no-brainer.

I want you to take the time and think, if a game like Call of Duty, R6 Siege, or Marvel Rivals basically remade their entire matchmaking system to a point to where the game itself is so overrun with cheaters and bots that you can't get into a match for YEARS on end, the developers of the game in question would be publicly humiliated and nobody would buy a game from them again.

If any Valve employee reads this review, please for the love of god do not make the same mistakes with Deadlock as you have with TF2.

If you find what I said absolutely abhorrant, please do not play TF2 and go play something else, and to the community, please do not forget what Valve has done to this game, they knowingly allowed the bot crisis to keep going for nearly 5 whole years, 2 after the #FixTF2 movement.

Its not the game anyone remembers, or thinks they know.
Almost every facet of TF2 barring the basic gameplay is changed for the worse. The balancing is worse, the performance is bad if not worse, the cosmetics almost always get more gaudy with every update, and lets not discuss Casual and Competitive, which single handedly killed people talking to one another over the ingame voice chat.

Sure we get holiday events, but they are often broken and un-playtested maps, it is clear that you, Valve, have long moved on and forgotten the game, yet you continue to milk the community for more and more cosmetic money. Sure you ""helped"" the bot problem, but that was after what, 6 years? How can you put your name on a game with such a rampant problem, and leave it untouched for so long, then come back for one update. All because you are putting out a new game, Deadlock, and it would look bad to have such a stain on your reputation. I love the maybe 1-2 active devs left on this game, and this is in no way hate on them, they have put so much time and effort into a game clearly forgotten by it's parent company. This hate is aimed at Valve the corporation. While the bot problem is somewhat fixed for now, that will not last forever, and if we look at the past, it is unlikely to receive serious, continuous work from an actually reasonably sized dev team that is required. 
Once again, stop milking the community for money, either take your hands off, or hire more than 2 devs so they can actually address the problems that have plagued the game for so long.",False

440,"TF2 community, remember what this game used to be, we're the only reason it's alive and the only reason it's profitable, which is all that Valve cares about.

But the state at which this game has been left in for so long is unacceptable.
The love for this game is not being reciprocated, we all love this game and it's time to demand that Valve love it back.

I can't recommend against playing it, it's one of the greatest masterpieces in gaming, but 
DO NOT SPEND A DIME on this game, Valve doesn't deserve a single penny. 
Our wallets may be a drop in the bucket of Valve's profits, but don't pay for a broken product

-Sincerely, a TF2 Fan 
I do not recommend you spend money on this game",False
440,"Well well well...I got this game a try around in 2023 or 2024. And I kinda hated it. But after some time I gave the game a second chance because of all the TF2 content flooding my phone. And I do not regret trying it again! This game is briliant. And even after all these years, it's still going. YEAHHH sure, it havent been updated by valve in decades but who cares?! This game is always fun! But you will maybe die alot at start, but thats ok. Get used to this goofy cartoony violent game and leave behind those games that tries to look like it was made in 3036 or smth. Come on! What are you waiting for?",True
440,"After playing the game for several thousand hours across multiple accounts, my first time starting back in 2013 I can safely say that back then I would've recommended it.  However in 2025 I can't say the same.  No game in history has been so thoroughly abused as Team Fortress 2 has been, and will continue to be.

Any other game making tens of MILLIONS a year would expect to see very adamant developer support, yet TF2 sees absolutely nothing save for them adding a few pieces of community made content a year.  No balance changes, no updates, nothing.   

A shocking amount of reviews give praise at them handling the bot crisis (which made casual quite literally unplayable for nearly 9 entire years) and give the game a positive review.  Those people are wrong, and far too generous.  If Portal had a bug where you couldn't click the play button in the main menu thus keeping the game unplayable, you wouldn't praise them for fixing it, it'd be an expectation of them to keep their game in a playable state.  The community owes it to the game and themselves to be FAR more critical of valves rampant and shameless neglect of this game.

To draw an ugly comparison, Fallout 76 is currently more updated and more developed than TF2, despite making a fraction as much in yearly revenue.  Fallout 76, was 2018's biggest gaming laughing stock, yet is currently being updated and developed better than TF2. 

It deserves much better than this, and frankly the communities constant positivity towards valve for providing less than the bare minimum disgusts me.  Seemingly forgetting 8 years of it being unplayable as soon as the game is acknowledged even slightly by valve.  Any other game would be beyond blessed for such a forgiving community, yet at ever possible chance valve takes the TF2 community for granted, happy to siphon their money but completely unwilling to listen to them unless it makes it's way to the mainstream media. (Remember, the only reason valve even addressed the bots was because they spammed slurs and media outlets picked up on this.  Valve simply responded by making free accounts unable to chat, ALL free accounts including innocent players.  Then once they'd hit the mute button they continued to let the bots run wild)

Until the game recieves the proper care it deserves I can't in good faith give it a positive review.  Nothing short of getting a true team of developers and active communication towards valve is acceptable.  Even in the event this is achieved the years of neglect won't go away, nor should the community EVER let them forget about it.

I won't.",False

Only positive is that its at least better then Counter Strike 2. That game is meh. At least to me it is. I dont understand how people can put 10000 hours or more into it. Same with this game. I always see it on peoples accounts. 10000 or more playing either this or Counter Strike 2. Man people these days have some odd taste.",False
440,"After over 4 years with other games, I decided today to play some TF2 once again. It wasn't fun. As spoiled food won't give you anything but food poisoning, so this game is no longer what it was, and will never be again. 2016 has ended 8 years ago. It's time to move on.",False
440,"I can't in good conscience thumbs up this game. Eight years of bots solved by an unaffiliated part time contractor over two years is clear evidence Valve willingly let this game rot. The developers of this game no longer work at Valve and it's clear the current staff only want a modern Esport game they can use to sell gambling boxes with.

It's a free game so as a consumer you're spending nothing but your time here but with bots seemingly creeping back in and knowing full well Valve is intentionally ignoring it's player base, I don't know why you'd want to at this point.",False
440,"As someone who has played this game all the way back in 2014 I can say 100% that this game is not the same compared to what it once was. The comp matchmaking has completely and utterly fucked this game to the core. I can't go a single match that isn't some kind of one way stomp in which one team heavily outclasses the other 99% of the time because everyone just leaves the fucking game when that happens, and who can blame them? Team scramble doesn't exist anymore and the autobalance is completely irrelevant either way, what the fuck is one person who gets chosen by fate seemingly out of the blue going to do when the entire other team that they now joined is fucking gone? I used to love the shit out of this game, but every single match I enter is no longer fun, winning or losing, I either stomp the other team in an instant or I get my teeth kicked in down my throat in less than like 5 minutes. 

I can't even really play this game anymore, even after signing up for the whole ""Save TF2"" all it did was send a bunch of fuck off YouTubers to valve saying ""hey guys, look how many people care about this game!"" they don't give a single shit about this game anymore and the state of causal has been like this for nearly a DECADE. The worst part has to be the fucking toxic positive side of the community, they have brainwashed like 67% of the people who play it. The only people who actually, and like GENUINELY, enjoy this game, are the dipshits with playtime hours challenging the length of the fucking universe. No one I know now who used to play this for fun, plays it anymore. I want to love this game, and I want to love playing it, but that is just fantasy.

Don't get this game, don't invest into it, your wasting your time. Valve will never revert the soul killing changes to the matchmaking because they don't give a fuck anymore, they made good games 20 years ago, and most of the people who worked on those games are no longer at the company.

440,"An amazing but NEGLECTED GAME that is kept ""alive"" by ILLUSIONS.

Such an amazing game that is neglected by Valve, it saddens me to say this.
This game doesn't get (truly) updated, it receives band-aids to create illusions that something is getting better, but the disaster that was Meet your match has made it into a bot infested hellscape that was only recently fixed, which doesn't justify the years of neglect (neglect that is still happening) whilst offering this product as ""playable"" to the potential players that will become buyers through microtransactions.
It is clear that Valve keeps it alive on life support because it still makes them money, which is unfortunate because it allows them to neglect one of the best FPS games ever made without many consequences.
It IS an amazing game, but it is factually dead, a zombie just coasting through the world trying to fit in amongst the living. 
Valve (not just one good Samaritan at Valve) needs to start making REAL updates - revert Meet your match (for example), create new content (real content like new weapons, gamemodes or maps designed by them) OR just finally admit (which they never will) that this game's purpose is to slowly fade out of existence whilst making another 10 million a year for them so that they give us the illusion that the things players spent money on in ALL of their games is worth spending and will last (which it won't and cannot).

I understand the business side of things and why it's neglected, but it doesn't justify it nor does it make it any better.",False
440,"no real updates in years, no/awful tutorial, valve consistently fumbling patches and new features, unholy amount of micro-transactions, in any other game just one or two of these problems would be death sentences. tf2 has all of these and more, the game is only being weekend at bernie-d by the dedicated community. Valve doesnt deserve tf2 players.",False
440,"After many years of neglect. This game has shown Valve's true colors. Pushing competitive in a game that couldn't directly facilitate the original design of this game. Meanwhile, year after year. Shoving micro after micro that's not even created by Valve. They're always making millions on this game and the only thing that ""fixed"" this broken game was a hired contractor who asked to work on this game on their own volition part time, that more or less put a cap on the bots and cheaters. 

While that's going, MYM/Casual (Meet Your Match) is still a broken mess that doesn't even do it's job correctly the vast majority of the time. Everything from having to wait for a match to start for an excessive amount of time. (compared to quick play) To matches ending quickly because of both steam rolling and not having a sufficient amount of players in one team or another. While the game director looks for new players to fill in those slots. Also not to mention that you couldn't continuously play uninterrupted like you previously could with quick play. 

The only real way to enjoy this game is through community made servers. Why bother giving this company money when it will do next to nothing to uplift their active flagship title? Why not throw 1 million dollars out of the billions they have into a dedicated, contracted team to keep their game up-to-date and running correctly? This will pay itself out by tenfold and get Valve into everyone's good graces once more. But I guess E-sports and gamba are just far too enticing and worthwhile to them than fixing what they have broken in the first place. It's a real shame and a stain to their reputation as a good company.",False

On top of that, the games updates are super limited and it hasten gotten a proper update in years. Another thing is the bots and cheaters, like any other shooter game it will have its fair share of cheaters but this game has held alot of bots that made the game nearly unplayable, at this time though, the bot situation has been solved by now, however, we have no clue how long that will last.

The 2016 ""Meet Your Match"" update gutted a very fine (but not perfect, mind you) casual matchmaking system, Quickplay, for an inferior bot-abused half-baked e-sport oriented one. Still had a great deal of chaotic TF2 fun but [i]I'm very disappointed in Valve[/i].

I'll preface this that despite what my game info might tell, I had another account where I had +4500 hours on the game.
I started around 2010 with some of my friends, one community Orange map server was one of our regular hangouts for years. Lots of laughs and good late night memories. Fond times.
Loved the game, it's chaotic and friendly atmosphere. Cosmetics were a nice plus as you still could chat normally while being F2P.
Quick play came along and was nice for jumping in without thinking too much.

Life and school does its thing, I get very busy in 2015 and boom it's late 2024. I lost my previous account.
I decide to jump back on TF2, join a game through the new matchmaking system named ""Casual Play"" and..
[list]
  [*]I can't even call medic OR chat while F2P?!
  [*]I can't even switch teams at a whim?! Even when the other team is bleeding player because they get stomped? And I can't vote scramble?!!!!
  [*]I can't extend map time anymore?!
  [*]I can't join official Valve servers with the server browser anymore?!
  [*]The nice community & Valve server UI search with settings is gone?!
  [*]I can only have 6 friends in my party?!!
[/list]

Despite all that I still had amazing interactions and good time fragging, but seeing those good features taken for granted ripped out felt like a kick in the nuts especially the ""F2P not allowed to chat or call for Medic"" one.
At least, I got back when the great majority of bot and cheaters got banned. I can't even begin to imagine what the experience was for new players for years outside of community servers.

I could recommend this game if :
[list]
  [*]Quickplay came back
  [*]F2P players have their mouth back.
  [*]An actual full tutorial for each class would be great for newbies.

440,"'Team Fortress 2' is a video game that I DO NOT RECOMMEND to other players.

As a player who has spent more than 2000 hours practicing and playing in this video game throughout multiple different Steam accounts, I have slowly but surely started to lose my originally rose-tinted perception of Team Fortress 2 and started to see many of its flaws.

Human players that use cheating/hack software (colloquially referred to as 'cheaters/hackers'), automated player bots that use cheating/hack software (colloquially referred to as 'bots') and players who actively support cheaters/hackers and bots make up a non-negligible portion of the game's playerbase.

Team Fortress 2 (colloquially referred to as 'TF2') has been neglected/abandoned by its developers (Valve Corporation/Software). There are still many unfixed bugs/exploits in the game, though only some of them are potentially game-breaking/unfair. TF2 has yet to receive a major update in more than 8 years (at the time of writing; 2 February 2025).

The community of TF2 is generally an echo chamber for extremely toxic/hostile/aggressive/rude individuals that also seem to be addicted to toxic positivity.

TF2 is an extremely old video game with many veterans who have played the game for more than a decade; making joining TF2 as a new player extremely challenging as most players would be constantly killed repeatedly. TF2 requires players to sink at least a few dozen hours practicing mechanics in order to not be an absolute burden to their teammates or to not die repeatedly. Additionally, TF2 is not popular so players oftentimes will meet the same fate over and over again or struggle to even join a server that is not empty.

However, TF2's plethora of official and community-made content/media in the form of recordings of gameplay footage, guides, documentaries, short videos, series of animated films and even entire movies are still quite enjoyable to this day, though they usually depict TF2 in its former glory days (about 2007-2018).

In conclusion, Team Fortress 2 is now an unpleasant shell of its former self that will likely remain stagnant or perhaps even worsen for the rest of its lifespan.",False
440,"Team Fortress 2 is a classic team-based shooter from Valve that’s been popular since its release in 2007. Featuring nine distinct classes, each with unique abilities, the game promotes teamwork and strategy. Its cartoony art style and humorous characters add charm, setting it apart from other FPS games.

Despite its age, TF2 remains fresh thanks to regular updates and community-created content. While occasional issues with bots and cheaters can be frustrating, Valve has continued to support the game over the years.

Overall, Team Fortress 2 is a fun, fast-paced game that still stands out in the multiplayer genre, offering great replay value for both newcomers and veterans alike.

440,"After playing this game on and off for over a decade (even though the playtime wouldn’t really suggest it), I have come to the conclusion that this game should be taken off life support, something Valve would obviously celebrate, as evidenced by complete disregard of the player base time and time again.

Team Fortress 2 is so, so painfully a product of its time, where “its time” is every single time Valve pushed out a large update. We got cosmetics (also limited-time ones, given for arbitrary reasons) and microtransactions, then matchmaking and some perverse version of achievements with rewards (Jungle Inferno contracts, anyone?) Finally, we settled on rampant cheating. If I could, I would instead write a review on Valve Anti-Cheat, but here we are…

Botting on TF2 got so bad that it was impossible to play, which is something that Valve doesn’t care about anymore if there’s profit in there somewhere. It was only after the community rallied together that Valve “fixed” the issue, but, to this day, if you play long enough and pay enough attention, you will run into more “subtle” cheaters every few games, because commercial solutions exist to cater to such audiences (see: LMAOBOX). Valve’s “anti-cheat” can be completely bypassed by existing open-source code snippets, leading us back to the point that TF2 is truly a product of its time, where basic detection techniques were good enough and everything else past that was duct-taped on top. Now, with the game being maintained by a skeleton crew, there is simply no hope of the situation ever improving. There might be further instances of grand ban waves, but, in the end, it's a war of attrition that Valve will lose.

Taking a small detour on to other things stemming from the game’s age - if you’ve played Quake about as long as TF2, you’ll be experiencing a familiar aura of “the meta must not be broken” throughout several game modes (“ye intel shalt not be capped” in CTF and “thou shalt not suck” in Mann Up), not to mention getting destroyed by players with thousands upon thousands of hours spent playing, who may or may not be cheating. Despite all that, there are always new players to be found. Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, they try to have fun in whatever way they see fit, but the more grizzled veterans know that having newbies in your team means getting stomped in a match.

“Why?”, you ask, “doesn’t the matchmaking system use some sort of rating to balance things out? Aren’t teams rebalanced if someone leaves or joins?”

*sigh*",False
440,"This game is my new favorite game. It has many variety of characters, weapons, and cosmetics.

440,"Valve willingly broke the game over 8 years ago with matchmaking (which coincides with the time the majority of talent left the company), and now instead of fixing things they broke with their crooked hands they're just giving up by releasing sdk.

440,"Only played this game for the first time 2 years ago and I still play it now. Its a great game in my opinion. A game which i feel is still a great game that competes with the many others on PC. This is the only shooter i haven't hated or gotten bored of and that's rare if you know me.

I like how this game works compared to others out there. The characters and weapons that come with them as different classes is good but how Team Fortress does it, its just the best I've played. There's plenty of game modes and the community is relatively good.
Cheaters keep becoming less common and same goes for them bots. Haven't seen one of them in a while and if you don't know what I'm on about its the bots that constantly promote cheeky websites and gambling sites and sometimes played strange noises, They also had aim bot but that's besides the point. 
There is no skilled based matchmaking but tbf i have never had an issue with that. I feel like you always have fair enough opponents. I must say though that new players will struggle at first with finding points. I always recommend you try training and fight some bots on different game modes. The bots are actually pretty good to practice with in the beginning to find what characters or classes you like. This game can also be good fun with friends, if you rock like a heavy-medic duo or something like that.
One last thing about this game is you need to buy something to unlock the chat feature and competitive. This unlocks your account and you may think this is an awful thing but its really not. It can stop some cheaters and players who are there to troll and annoy others. Plus the things you can buy in the game are cheap anyways like basic keys are only striking around 2 pound now a days and that's the same in dollars.

Personally I think this game is great. Its a good shooter game made by the company that runs steam. Once very popular and maybe not so much anymore but i think it still stands out. Highly recommend.",True

440,"I have been in the loop with this game for at least a decade. I don't play it as often as I would like to, but if you were to see the problems and abuse the game truly has had over ninety percent of that span, then you would see exactly why it would drive even the most hardcore of comp players away for so long. It is still depressing to see just how lazy the developers were to the point where they decided to put the source code into the SDK in the 2/18/2025 update. I'll come back once Team Fortress 2 Classic properly launches as a mod later this year, but for the base game itself, a decade ago I would have recommended it for anyone to get into.

Time passes and a lot of things do change. I still have a heart for this masterpiece of an FPS shooter, but it was just the incompetence, laziness, abandonment and poor treatment the game got with barely any updates to show for, which also meant no weapon balances for an example.  These days, it's rare for me to get on this. At least three times a year I do play for about two weeks minimum before hanging the phone up, but that's still a lot of hours I can put in compare to the others that had to cold turkey the game after the long mistreatment it was receiving.

I don't strongly recommend this game, but I would at least still recommend it to at least give it a try to experience why so many adore the game, its community, and the solid gameplay, alongside its cast of colorful mercenaries.",True

This game is still amazing, from it's community to it's game modes, (even if some are basically dead) I'd still recommend it to people who somehow have never played it.

440,"hands down... the best video game ever made.  Just look at how many hours I got on record of this game

has some technical issues and some unpolished areas and outdated a bit But none the less the PROs OUT WEIGH the cons, it's very fun.

and if you're interested about what the CONs are...

1. The game's tutorial only teaches you about 4 of the classes you can play as. (there are 9) And it generally does a poor job at being a tutorial, it misses a lot of points and very important details that you'll need. It never tells you what said button does what. So I recommend looking up online, maybe a video!

2. The game suffers from really bad performance, the developers didn't put as much optimization work. So if you have a weak old computer you're gonna have to down a performance config online I recommend Mastercomfig as it provides the best performance and chose your preset that suits you. Medium high is good enough. And hell even if you have a good computer you're still gonna need mastercomfig

3. The game has issues with balance. It still does a good job at balancing everything there is. but there are weapons that are just quite literally very useless. And the sniper class if you're really really good at aiming, is very powerful in open maps he can destroy a lobby as a headshot can instantly kill about 5/9 of the classes.
The medic has an unlockable healing gun called the Vaccinator. If you're good at using it, then oh boy is it really powerful as well
And The engineer notably has two frustrating to fight against unlockables called the Wrangler and short circuit which is quite unblanced. The wrangler doesn't take much effort or work, by simply pressing 2 or switching to the wrangler your turret triples it's health and you have full control over it. And the short circuit is heavily spammable, each alt-fire shot takes away 65 of the engineer's metal (he can hold up to only 200 at max) and it shoots this spherical projectile energy that is also blinding and if any explosive projectiles are also around it's space it'll disintegrate them to ash basically deleting them.
All of these issues are commonly the problems TF2 players face, as it's frustrating to fight against what I talked about.

4. The game match maker is bad. Just watch Zesty jesus's ""TF2: You Will (Not) Play"" video about why it's bad 
(skip to 2:25:20)

5. The developers abandoned the community, the game is no longer getting good quality content updates. only on Summer or holidays to which it only brings more maps that can either be bad or decent and more hats which are finally starting to have better quality as before it was a bunch of slop and repetitive content that doesn't even fit the game's theme and art style

6. If you want to do game communications either mic-voice talk or do class voicelines or type in chat. You need to have a verified steam account meaning you bought a game that is 4$+ or bought a TF2 Item for 4$+ you'll be able to talk

7. There are cheaters and the anti-cheat is doing a bad job at preventing, cheaters destroying games (as of writing this, I haven't encountered a cheater in a while ever since valve's new moderation of actually starting to ban cheaters, we still don't know if this is handled automatically by a system or by human

There's a bunch I've missed but most are minor issues so didn't feel like naming them",True

440,"Good Character design, MOSTLY good weapon design, cosmetics are either designed ASS or actually good, the casual Match making system is NOT that good because of how slow the valve servers allow people to join games were people left (But it is the most played mode in the game), communitty servers are mostly dead but the most servers that are alive have toxic admins or are all in all just bad (I don't want to name any names here.) The community is a 2 sided blade 50% are the most tolerant and friendly people you've ever seen and the other 50% are toxic, edgy and bad people who ruin the entire communyties image. If you wan't to buy any items on the game use thirdparty sites because the valve shop ingame scamms you, but when youre searching for sites use safe ones that dont try to scamm anything out of you. The mechanics in this game are wonderfull and fun to play with, also if you see someone suspiciously hitting you it could be the games goofy hitboxes so it maybe is not a cheater, but the game is house of some closet cheaters. The game has sadly been abandoned by valve. (If you want more information about that go to youtube channels like ""Zesty Jesus"". 

To conclude: The game is a must play and you should try it, if youre new the lerning spann of the game will be mostly short to medium. (Well so was it for me.) I want to thank everyone for reading my review and wish you all a great day/night bye!














































Ohh yeah and I like the Jojo cosmetics and the conscious objectors in this game theyre pretty cool.

440,"In 2008 I bought Team Fortress 2 for the first time, and that was the beginning of a real gaming story, full of bright emotions, funny moments and a warm community. From the first minutes I was struck by the stylish cartoon-inspired visual design and unique gameplay, where each class is a separate universe with its own character and mechanics. 
As time went on, TF2 only blossomed. Updates like “The Sniper vs. Spy Update” or the legendary ‘Mann-Conomy’ not only added new weapons, but also expanded the lore of the game, filling it with humor and crazy plots. Team Fortress 2 is not just a game, but a phenomenon that unites millions of players around the world.
Thank you, Valve, for this masterpiece. For a game that has become home to millions of players. For emotions that don't fade even after a decade. Team Fortress 2 is a timeless classic, and I'm glad to be a part of its story.

440,"""The most fun you can have online."" - PC Gamer

Was thinking about leaving a meme review here, but I think a honest review might actually be more appropriate. Let me just get the general point out of the way; This game is amazing, and you'll never find another game like it. Seriously. There are several classes to pick from. Scout prefers rushing the enemy, using movement to his advantage and dodging the enemy's attacks while getting up close and personal. Soldier caters to anyone who likes dealing a lot of damage, but still wants lots of mobility. Pyro is good for ""men who just want to see the world burn."" You can hop into a server, brand new to the game, and terrorize the enemy team. While he has his fair share of mechanics that certainly take practice, I'd say Pyro is a easy-to-pickup, effective class (and the preferred choice for most new players.) Demoman, similar to soldier, caters to people who like taking an explosive approach with a sprinkle of mobility. You can just lay explosives everywhere and watch as the enemy team explodes into pieces like legos. The heavy is a tank, and will lead lots of pushes and be the prime target for Uber-Charges, which we'll go over later. He has a large health pool, does lots of damage, but this is all at the cost of Heavy's mobility. Engineer is great for players who want the best of both worlds. A support role, and a defense (and occasionally offense) role. His mounted sentry guns prove incredibly effective at area-denial, his dispensers provide health and ammo quickly to any teammates that need it, and his teleporters help keep the pressure on the enemy team by providing a quick path from spawn to the front lines. Medic is the purest form of support class. His main utility is his Medi-Gun, which can heal teammates at impressive rates. On top of this, after a certain amount of healing he will have a special attack. These range from types of Medi-Guns, but most of them provide invulnerability or upper hand over the enemy team in some form for a limited period of time. Sniper is great for picking off enemies for your team while they are leading a push, and chances are you'll be the first to spot most enemies. It keeps the pressure off of your team and can be a crucial part of a victory. And last, but not least, spy. Being possibly the most unique out of all the 9 classes, the spy has the ability to go invisible for a limited time, disguise as members of the enemy team, disable the enemy engineer's buildings, and instantly kill any enemies with a swift stab to the back. He uses these tools to get behind the enemy, and similarly to sniper, relieves pressure from your team.

Now that you have a brief description of the 9 classes, let's get to the more miscellaneous things that make this game special. Starting with the art style. I believe Team Fortress 2's art style has single-handedly influenced dozens of other games. Its cartoony nature provides a comedic environment. The game also has taunts, being one of the first of its kinds to do so. Many pair these taunts with something called kill binds. For example, if someone were to high-five you, they would press a button causing them to instantly die upon their hands' impact. The humor in this game is also great. The mercenaries all have unique personalities. The voice-lines can create comedic conversations, and there are so many mechanics to learn in this game. There are even sub-classes, which is a combination of a classes items to completely change it's game-play. All the different game-modes are unique to each other. While the main ones focus on teamwork, others like Medieval Mode are not very serious but can provide lots of entertainment. And would you look at that, I've gone and written a whole essay. I hope this gives a better idea of why this game is so special to so many people, and why it changed my perspective on games as a whole, but honestly If I tried to cover everything about this game we'd be here all day. Thanks, and have fun!",True

440,"Team Fortress 2 is a game that can't be described by someone other than yourself. You could stick to standard servers, play MvM, play competitive, or browse the thousands of custom servers.

Standard servers and Competitive: at most, 16v16. you have capture the flag, king of the hill, payload, and point defense as some of the main game modes. there are more than that, but these will be the ones you see the most, as most of the community likes at least one of what i listed above.

MvM: Mann versus machine. You and five others team up to defend a base from ai-controlled robot armies, with being able to upgrade yourselves based on how well you perform. You'll earn weapons, robot parts, and killstreak kits that make your weapons glow or shine, or give you special effects. If you're extremely lucky, you might even get a golden weapon.

Custom Servers: Well, this is where the crazy comes in. How about instead of 16v16, we do 50v50? or maybe 1 really strong dude with superpowers versus 31 regular guys? maybe you'd like to experience risk of rain in Team Fortress 2? or, you know what? maybe you'd like to play an adventure game like ocarina of time. Or a tower defense? what about prop hunt? a clicker game? maybe you want to run around as a guy half the normal size doing the conga and collecting coins secretly to make yourself stronger? Did i mention that all of what i just said was created by the community? because all of them are. and I, personally, feel that custom servers are where TF2 shines. the standard gameplay.

I dont have much to say, im still an F2P. But all I can say is that this game is fun. Yes, my laptop (that still has counter strike 1.5 in it) may not be able to handle community servers and im broke as hell because im too young, the community? love it.
I didn't make that much friends, and the only time i got a free item is this game, provided by 'theskylion' or 'Skyy'. 

Skyy, I will never forget about the time you traded me a Rocket Jumper in this game. As an F2P I struggled trying to get items I want, and due to this I mostly stuck to classes like Spy or Pyro. You are the only man that gifted me an item, even though you are a stranger that might quit TF2 sooner or later, your item will be cherished in my inventory.

Thank you. (and love you valve)",True

Worst part is that I know it'll never be fixed.

Thanks for the past, TF2. You've left a wonderful mark on the internet, but the game has gone well past its welcome now, when it had the potential to be entirely timeless.

To utilize a character to it's fullest requires actually skill, thought process, positional understanding, and a degree of humbleness. Someone can always best you regardless of the class they are playing or the loadout they're using. It never takes itself too seriously as there is an onslaught of wacky weaponry,  random crits, and lenient spawning that make it sort of lighthearted and less sweaty. There is no team deathmatch; to win is to take an objective and that is endlessly refreshing. Taking an objective feels like traditional trench warfare. Your team establishes a position, takes an advantage, and tries to push against the other side who is also doing the same. This game has maintained a community since 2007 which is saying something.
That being said, besides this games uncomparable design, this game's developer is Valve. In 2010, with the introduction of the Mann-conomy update, Valve ruined an entire generation of games. This is one of the most widely known instances of Crate Economy. Crate economy is digital NFT gambling before NFTs existed. You find a crate, you buy a key, and you get a random useless cosmetic to show your friends you are willing to put more down on the game. This allows children to actually gamble, which is illegal. Plus its without all of the laws in place on fair gambling. By around 2012-2013 Steam introduced Steam Marketplace, a secondary market which you could trade these items with other players for Steam cash value at a taxed rate. Yes, this idea already existed in several MMORPGS. BUT here's the caveat, ""illegal"" (illegalized by terms and agreement's bonds made by company's when signing up for a game) secondary markets were affordable and you paid for the direct value of the work put into the game itself. It allowed dedicated players to access a free market for video games that often times required way too much actually time for something that was totally virtual. A product that had no form, function, or bearing in the real world. This marketplace would encourage a game's community by giving value to the amount of time spent in the title. Now here's where I wrap it back to Steam Marketplace.
Valve didn't have an MMORPG. They had a team shooter. Typically in 2000s MMORPGS these aftermarket items would have some bearing or use in the game that was beneficial. There became an uptick trend around 2007 for these aftermarket items to be purely cosmetic and limited time restricted. Valve saw this and wanted a piece of the pie. Crates, conceptually, is a lose-lose deal for the buyer. The buyer spends 2.50 for a key in game, the key does nothing except access limited items, and the items can only be sold or traded for other Steam inventory items. The 2.50 put down is lost and the only money gained is within the context of Steam. The only way around this is through game keys, which are sold on the aftermarket to make games that are more expensive on Steam cheaper. Now here's where it gets good:
Steam taxes 12% on any marketplace sale that happens. So if you bought a key at 2.50 and want to get rid of it, Steam makes 30 cents off the sale of such. Even with you purchasing this NFT, Steam always keeps a portion of the process. Here's a basic principle in economics, why change something if it provides you more income than the initial merchandise. So, with the usage of a model created by game players, Steam successfully monopolized video games and their micro-economics as a whole. This being done without the creation of new games or innovative features. 
They simply made so much money off this one concept every Triple A Industry Developer was forced to copy this model. PC Gaming quickly became the only way to develop a title. No other Marketplace was able to compete with the resounding popularity of Steam's platform, nor the capabilities of it, nor could they afford to even support themselves because Valve could simply buy them out.
So because of this one update what did Steam focus it's platforms usage on besides it's own meta economy? Data collection. Steam harvests so much data from your computer. Look at Steam Webhelper's data usage on a monthly basis. Valve knows everything about you, from the medications you take, to your relationships, to your work, to your insecurities, to what you find funny. It runs constantly in the background gathering every little bit of who you are. Why? You may have wanted to find enjoyment within these titles and find an escape from the world because it's cold and wicked. It may have given you hope that you could give someone a brand new type of experience that they couldn't get from the real world. Relationships with people you'd never meet, ideas you'd never see. Guess what? It's gone. Because of crates. Literally NFT crates.
As a side note, THEY DON'T EVEN MAKE THE CONTENT FOR THIS GAME ANYMORE. THE COSMETICS? FAN-MADE. MAPS? FAN-MADE. GAMETYPES? FAN-MADE. THE COMMUNITY MAKES IT AND VALVE SCORES THE CASH THAT IS HOW BACKWARDS THIS WHOLE SYSTEM IS.
They removed custom matchmaking. They haven't updated VAC Anti-cheat in forever, CS-GO 2 and 1 still see this problem, even while being the most popular game today. Hackers are all over the place. These same hackers if provoked could use multiple fake accounts to get you legit banned. The last update to add mechanically new weapons was in 2017. That's a whapping 7 years since they added anything functionally new. The in-game economy is still there and thriving, you can find certain items for thousands of real dollars. Every. Single. Holiday. They release new cosmetics. Every year new crates with new skins. 
TF2: I give it a 10/10. It was one of my favorite games ever growing up. It was a beacon of what a team shooter could look like and still be fun.
Valve: not on the scale. Actual privacy violating demons of individuals. Valve is an information gang. I don't say that lightly. If you are young and looking to play a classic and you read this review. Stop. Playing. Video games. You are selling the people in your life out to nerds who flip a silly hat with a fire effect over and over again and make thousands off of you even logging in to the client and downloading this game.",False

The things I love about this game are the diversity of classes you can play. The only downside to this game really, is that updates are few and far between. It would be great to get more content updates, however, I can say that I've been more than satisified with this game since its release.",True

440,"There are video games, and then there is Team Fortress 2. To call it a game is a disservice—it is a way of life, a sacred text, a digital pantheon where gods of war battle in an eternal, blood-soaked ballet. And among them, one figure stands above all. Not the soldier, nor the spy, nor the so-called ""sniper."" No, the true messiah of destruction is Pyro—the flame-clad harbinger of judgment, the burning whisper in the night, the nightmare that stalks the battlefield with a muffled giggle.

I do not play Pyro. I become Pyro. Every fiber of my being ignites with the righteous fury of the flamethrower. The weak cry out for mercy. They are met with a cleansing inferno. The so-called ""skilled"" players—those who scoff at Pyro as a mere ""W+M1"" peon—soon learn the truth. There is no escape from the fire. The airblast sends their rockets spiraling back into their foolish faces, their pitiful attempts at aiming shattered by the sheer, unrelenting chaos of close-quarters immolation. The flanking Spy? I hear his footfalls. The retreating Medic? I smell his fear. The Heavy, the Demo, the Scout—all of them burn the same in the end.

TF2 itself is a masterpiece—chaotic, hilarious, and endlessly replayable. But Pyro? Pyro is a philosophy, a manifesto of destruction, a fever dream where fire is the only truth. To those who still doubt, who resist the cleansing embrace of the flames—I say to you: pick up the flamethrower. Don the mask. Forget words, forget hesitation. Speak only in fire.

440,"after only taking a short 4 years to fix the chronic botting problem, valve has finally made the real tf2 casual experience accessible: experiencing someone being racist every 3 games because valve's approach to moderation is 'moderation is for losers who do treadmill work'
if that doesn't appeal to you, feel free to join one of three popular community server networks to play a grand total of eight of the 100+ maps in the game because people can't imagine playing something other than the grand sniper sightline that is upward

[i]but if you can just ignore all that[/i]
The actual gameplay of TF2 is great, another testament to the raw talent that works at Valve, even nearly 20 years later (and some 8 years after the last time they felt like putting effort into a TF2 update). Nine classes with unique gameplay, greatly written characters, and a timeless artstyle. MvM is a great PvE mode, and the community server browser holds countless alternate gamemodes should the standard PvP get boring.
The game does still regularly receive seasonal updates consisting of community-made content, but by this point, the party was basically over some ten years ago. The game will continue to have some solid gameplay into the future (barring another 'bot crisis' or some other 'I can't play the game anymore' event), but it's unlikely TF2 will ever reach the heights of its heyday again.",True

Мне очень нравятся геймплей, стилистика, но больше всего мне нравятся персонажи, настолько, что волей неволей при более детальном рассмотрении у меня поднимается стручок. Однажды, я решил посмотреть р34 по своей любимой игре, это было незабываемо: мой член пульсировал, мои яйца потели и раздувались. Я не удержался и смачно передёрнул на эти мускулистые, мужественные образы. После такого страстного наслаждения я решил пойти на мге сервер. Я тащил как батя, наматывая гибусов пачками. Пришло время ложиться спать. Мои грязные мысли не давали мне покоя до часа ночи, но я наконец смог уснуть. Вдруг я просыпаюсь на Granary Middle. Из-за угла выходит крайне горячий, потный, мускулистый пулемётчик и говорит мне: *Малой, чё ты делаешь?*. Только от одной этой фразы я чуть не кончил. Он направился в мою сторону, попутно доставая свой огромный, мясистый пулемёт. Он натянул меня на него и расстрелял. Я проснулся окончательно с мокрыми трусами, к сожалению, это был всего лишь сон...",True

440,"This is my first public review of literally anything, so here goes. Sometime back in 2012 or 2013, I honestly can't even remember, that's how long ago it was, my classmate recommended this game to me. They showed me the trailers and various shorts that promoted the game that were dubbed in various different languages (up to a certain point, but that's a story for another time). Up to that point, I was into the more casual games like Peggle or Plants vs. Zombies. And seeing what my classmate showed me about this game, as well as seeing some of the art incorporated into the levels in Peggle Extreme, I immediately felt that this is a game that I must play the absolute heck out of! At that moment, the game was already Free to Play, so I thought ""screw it, might as well get it"".

At first, there have been some teething issues, like I had to learn from my classmate how to play certain classes, because the tutorial ended up being staggeringly unhelpful, as in it teaches you the basics of the first-person shooter genre, but not the intricacies of each class., let alone the Four that make up the tutorial to this day. Back then, I thought nothing of it, and just assumed more classes and more detailed tutorials would be added in a future update, this was a consistently updated game at the time, after all. Either way, the classmate showed me around, at least, showed me the important stuff, and answered the questions I would point out along the way.

Since I was too daunted by the sheer amount of servers in the browser, my friend decided it would be best for me to look for a server via Quickplay, and then as if by magic, they'd join the same server as well. Some Quickplay matches later, I'd end up getting used to using some of the server browser features as well, like adding servers to favorites, to come back to them later, or the Friends tab, to join the server my friend is on. We'd end up playing at 2fort the most, since that's where I had the most fun, they'd show me the different funny taunts this game had, including some of the paid taunts, like the Director's Vision, which they generously gifted to me. Then, an update came out that introduced Mann vs. Machine, and I cannot overstate how ecstatic I was playing that, both solo and with that friend. This was literally Plants vs. Zombies for me, but now the plants can move, and upgrade their stats. Since I'd already gotten the hang of the server browser, it would only be a matter of time until I'd stumble upon a server with some unofficial gamemode, or a custom map, so that was my introduction to trade maps. Did I care that people used it to... well, trade with each other on that server? Absolutely not, but rocket jumping across the Minecraft-style map or riding in a minecart was enough for me to have even more of an absolute blast. Don't even get me started about Surf servers! Point being, this game wasn't perfect, but I loved every minute of playing it. 

Years went by, me and my friend both finished school and slowly fell out of touch. I'm still friends with them on Steam, but to be frank, I'm too afraid to bother them now, I think he'd gotten some new friends. But then, so have I, and one of them just so happened to enjoy Team Fortress 2 as well. I remembered that just as I slowly got away from TF2, The Voldemort Devs (if you know, you know) added some sort of new competitive mode for TF2. And I thought, surely it can't get any better, now you can play TF2 in virtually the same way people now play CSGO. Of course, I was oblivious then to the intricacies of matchmaking even in CSGO, as I couldn't be bothered to learn the game. Either way, I boot up TF2 for the first time in a while, and I am absolutely astounded by what I was witnessing. Server browser filled with empty to half-empty servers, no option to Quickplay anymore, just Competitive, which I couldn't afford, Mann vs. Machine, which was also empty half the time, and this new mode called Casual. ""Ooh, Casual,"" I thought, ""That must be what the Quickplay has turned into."" So I completely ignored the warning sign of the empty community servers, and into the dark I lept.

No ability to choose/change team, no ability to spectate, no way to vote for a new map, or to scramble/autobalance. The rounds ended up being a billion times shorter, and you couldn't even extend them without a server reset (barring Capture the Flag, which had the time limit back then and for some reason doesn't now, meaning it can be played indefinitely, so long as both teams agree to not cap. And it's at this point I started to wonder ""Is this really TF2? Is this really the same game that introduced me to the other games by these Devs?"" It sure looks like it, the characters, items and maps are all still there, but... something's missing, something's wrong. And then it dawned on me, right as the game ended and the server reset.

Suddenly, only me and my friends are all that's left from the previous round. The rest either hasn't connected yet, or left the server to be replaced by bots. I was traumatized, I have only seen this kind of swarm of bots on poorly moderated servers back in the day, which were a tiny minority. But now, apparently it's a widespread problem, because as we keep on searching for casual servers, we stumble upon bots time and time again. Surely this can't be what the TF2 community wanted from the competitive matchmaking. Did the TF2 community even want the competitive matchmaking? I vaguely remember the huge hype surrounding it, but I don't remember where it came from, because the TF2 community as I knew it, was not competitive in the slightest. Sure there was some hostility towards Free-to-Players, but nothing over the top rival. Then I rewatched the videos from when competitive was introduced, and I, for the life of me, couldn't put a finger on who the people advocating for competitive TF2 even were. And advocate they did, there were whole interviews from these people with the Devs.

So that begs the questions. How did the Devs royally mess this up? How did they let some random group of unknown people that seem to have this tiny cult of personality built around them completely mangle the game beyond all recognition, to the point that it's so broken, that even the very group of people responsible for it, left for a different game?!

Of course, the bot issues have been fixed... for now, but I won't invest any more a dime into this game, than I did simply to talk in this game! It used to be free! It didn't deter bots from spamming slurs in chat, it only hurt innocent players! This game doesn't deserve the money! Do not repeat my mistake, stay muted in casual chat! In fact, only download TF2 to play mods of it, there will be no shortage of them, and all of them will allow for free chatting, free choice of server selection, and the tagline of ""The most fun you can have online"" should be given to TF2 mods instead. Invest into those, not the main game! Not until we see work being done by the actual Devs, not some contractor and their plant pot! And if they refuse, it will only be a cautionary tale for the fans of other multiplayer games from these Devs.",False

440,"Team Fortress 2, in my honest opinion, is one of the best games I have ever played. Even though the game was created more than a decade ago, the game still hasn't lost its hype, shown through the inclusive and wholesome community that hasn't lost its spark for all this time, arranging community events, items, and even petitions like #fixtf2. 
Not just that, but the gameplay is really immersive and unique. There are several modes in the game that you can engage in, the main gamemodes subdividing into 'Casual, Competitive, MVM, Custom, etc.' (Think it was called Custom? I really don't remember... might be called 'Online'). Casual features many different gamemodes like King of the Hill, Capture the Flag (my honest favorite gamemode), and more! Competitive is just what it sounds like: PROBABLY exactly the same as Casual but a lot sweatier (I haven't done a single Competitive round throughout my 300 hours lol). MVM is honestly my favorite gamemode. Even though it costs ~1. something USD, and its required to have more than one ticket to finish your, uh, 'quest' (forgot what its called), you get a ton of rewards everytime you beat the waves. You even have a chance of getting your own Australium weapon, basically a golden version of it. Even if you don't, you get a Killstreak...uh...something. Trust me, it looks cool when you apply it
Also, the different mercenaries (the characters) have really unique personalities/gameplay/dialouge/etc. For example, we have Soldier here, who is a proud American and loves to cover his vision with his hat, or Sniper here, with a thing for bottled Jarate (search it up), and maybe Spy here, a french
Each mercenary has unique weapons and stats, overall making the game much more fun and interesting, each character providing a different POV and gamestyle. Not just that, but there are 'subclasses' that aren't official, but classes you can use, such as the Hoovy (basically Heavy Weaponsguy the tank, except you slap sandwiches onto enemies) or the Demoknight (honestly one of my favorite subclasses, its when you give a drunk Scottish guy more scrumpy and a huge axe.
There are even special events once in a while, such as the Scream Fortress event (Halloween) where you have the chance to battle a monkey who oddly resembles Sniper, and Demoman's eye (you heard that right).
Forgot to mention this, but you get a wide range of weapons and cosmetics to select from. Each mercenary has many different weapons that are unique in their own ways, each effectively changing your gameplay. Cosmetics, well, self-explanatory.
Lastly (probably one of the best features in the game,) once in a while you can item drops that give you free weapons. No, you don't have to buy them seperately like DLCs, it just gives you a weapon once in a while. Is it a useful feature to most of the community? No. Do I think its just cool? Yes.
Overall, the game gets a 9/10. The only problem I can think of is because of the bots. That is all.
If you actually read the whole thing, I really appreciate it.",True
440,"Team Fortress 2 is one of those timeless classics that just never seems to die!

440,"TF2 A game that deserves more

TF2 or Team Fortress 2 is a game made by Valve that to this day of it’s 18 year life span has not received any major updates in a little over seven years. The last major update was the Jungle inferno update which brought maps, taunts, the jungle inferno campaign, new weapons for pyro and a bunch of balancing for all of the mercenaries, but ever since that it has been mostly quiet from Valve with the exclusion of some small updates here and there. The community has contributed their fair share with their own taunts and concepts being added during the holidays. From my information there are two devs working currently on the game (This may be false) realising small bug fixes every once in a while and yet TF2’s community flourishes having 50k players every single day and even reaching all-time player peaks during for example the summer of 2023. And yet Valve still ignores the game and its community.

Now here is where I make my point, TF2 and its community deserves better, better then how Valve’s treating it at least, TF2 deserves more. The only reason this will be a positive review is because first: i like the game, and second: I have heard from various sources that Valve are starting to notice that they still have people playing with their old toy. Also there are alot of thinks i would like to go in to about TF2 but in those seven years of no updates someone must have wrote something more comprehensive then whatever I would put out.

(My opinion will maybe change the review depending on how it all turns out).

This game is overwhelmingly chaotic and lacks a coherent structure, making it feel boring and trivial. With no story to engage players and a difficulty level that leans towards hard, it may frustrate those looking for a meaningful experience. The graphics are merely normal, and the music is forgettable, contributing to an overall sense of disinterest. While it might be free, I find it hard to recommend this game as it offers little more than confusion and a lack of replayability.

📜 Overview
Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is a class-based multiplayer first-person shooter (FPS) developed and published by Valve. Released in 2007, it has remained one of the most beloved free-to-play shooters thanks to its unique art style, diverse character classes, and humorous tone. Players choose from nine distinct classes and engage in objective-based gameplay across various maps and modes.

🌟 Pros
✅ Diverse Class System – Nine unique classes cater to different playstyles, from offensive to support roles.
✅ Iconic Art Style & Humor – A timeless cartoon aesthetic combined with witty character interactions.
✅ Wide Variety of Game Modes – Payload, Capture the Flag, King of the Hill, and community-made modes add variety.
✅ Strong Community Support – Dedicated fanbase, custom servers, and community-made content keep the game alive.
✅ Free-to-Play – The core gameplay is accessible to everyone, with optional cosmetic microtransactions.

⚠️ Cons
❌ Aging Graphics & Engine – Despite its charm, the Source engine is showing its age.
❌ Lack of Major Updates – Valve's support has slowed in recent years, with fewer major content drops.
❌ Bot & Cheater Issues – Public servers can suffer from bots and hackers due to lack of active moderation.
❌ Microtransaction Economy – The in-game market revolves around cosmetics and trading, which some players find overwhelming.
❌ Steep Learning Curve – While easy to pick up, mastering class mechanics and teamwork takes time.

They refuse to let this game die because it is a timeless masterpiece with an art-style that doesn't age, infinite possibilities for sub-classes with very different ways to play, so much variety with cosmetics and last but not least a hilarious community that if you ignore all the racists and bigots for a second, is the [i] last of it's kind.

If you have the bad luck to have a low behavior score (maybe for some old mistakes you made in the past years), there is no way to improve it. Losing a game means getting reported. And as I said, in 90% of the games, there is a smurf on the enemy team. Especially if you are a mid player, you need to wait at least 20 minutes to find a game.

Once you're below 7000, everyone around you doesn't learn. They are toxic, they blame you for everything. You can't rely on people for help, they will feed, they will steal your gold. 

Basically, the whole community of SEA is 10x more toxic than it was. I'm done, I can't seem to get a second chance and dota 2 doesn't seem to care. Hence I shall be quitting this game. Truly wish they didn't penalise us so much. Please stay clear of this game if you want a normal life.",False

570,"Dota 2 - A Masterpiece of Depth and Strategy

⭐ Rating: 10/10

Dota 2 is not just a game—it's an experience, a battleground of wit, skill, and teamwork that has defined the MOBA genre for over a decade. With over 120 heroes, each offering unique abilities and playstyles, no two matches are ever the same. The strategic depth is unmatched, requiring players to master mechanics, item builds, map awareness, and team coordination.

Pros:
✅ Infinite Replayability – No match ever plays out the same, ensuring endless fun and learning.
✅ Completely Free-to-Play – Every hero is available from the start, with no pay-to-win mechanics.
✅ High Skill Ceiling – Always room to improve, whether it's micro, macro, or decision-making.
✅ Thriving Esports Scene – The International and other tournaments keep the competitive spirit alive.
✅ Deep Strategy – Team composition, warding, counter-picking, and map control make every game a chess match.

Cons:
❌ Steep Learning Curve – The game can feel overwhelming for newcomers.
❌ Toxic Community – Like any competitive game, some players take things too seriously.
❌ Time-Consuming – Matches can last 30-60 minutes, making it hard for casual play.

Despite the challenges, Dota 2 is the ultimate test of skill and strategy. It’s brutally unforgiving but equally rewarding when mastered. If you’re looking for a game that will challenge you and provide endless depth, there’s no better choice.

Verdict:
Dota 2 is not for the faint of heart, but for those willing to invest time, it’s one of the most rewarding multiplayer experiences ever made.

Would I recommend it? Absolutely. But only if you're ready for a journey filled with both frustration and triumph.

570,"There is too many smurfs in the game and it ruins the fun of the game for those that just started to learn. I ran into a full team of smurfs in my second match and they immediately left before they could be reported for smurfing so they can be punished and be prevented from being in new player matches. 

The game is fun overall but it is overrun with smurf accounts that just wants to ruin the fun of the game for newer players which drives them away and not wanting to play again which can hurt the playerbase, please get this resolved so new players dont have to dodge this game forever and have equal fun with noobs vs noobs and Pros vs Pros in their proper area so noobs don't rage quit immediately and not play the game again.

570,"Having experienced moba games like League of Legends and Heroes of the Storm before, I think Dota 2 stands out with its unique variety of heroes, strategic depth and game mechanics. The skill sets of the heroes and the features offered by the items make the game very enjoyable. Every game teaches you something new and the fact that there is no limit to what you learn makes the game unique.

570,"Dota 2 is everything a MOBA should be. It allows you to play your way, with the hero you want, wherever you want. The infinite number of builds the game offers ensures that you never get bored while maintaining a high level of competitiveness. Initially, you may find it difficult to get into the game, but once you understand the mechanics and how everything works, it becomes much clearer. Because of this, Dota 2 is the best MOBA to invest in today.

One of the key strengths of Dota 2 is its diverse hero pool. With over 100 unique heroes to choose from, each with their own set of abilities, players can experiment with different strategies and playstyles. This variety ensures that no two games are ever the same, keeping the experience fresh and exciting.

Another aspect that sets Dota 2 apart is its complex and deep gameplay. The game requires players to master a wide range of skills, including team coordination, map awareness, and resource management. This depth makes Dota 2 not only a test of individual skill but also a showcase of strategic thinking and teamwork.

Furthermore, the Dota 2 community and esports scene are thriving. With regular tournaments and events, there's always something to look forward to, whether you're a casual player or a competitive enthusiast. The game's developers, Valve, consistently provide updates and balance changes, ensuring that the game remains fair and engaging for all players.

570,"""Dota 2"" is a game that often elicits a complex array of emotions from its players. Enthusiasts may rave about its depth and strategic intricacies while simultaneously expressing frustration with various aspects of gameplay. For newcomers, the experience can be particularly daunting; the game is notorious for its steep learning curve and can feel unwelcoming at first.

Indeed, ""Dota 2"" is not particularly new-player friendly. The wealth of information and mechanics can be overwhelming for those just starting out. In addition, the competitive nature of the community often means that solo players encounter teammates who may have a much higher level of experience, sometimes leading to criticism and hostility. This environment can be disheartening for beginners trying to find their footing.

To successfully navigate the initial challenges of ""Dota 2,"" I recommend focusing on a select group of five heroes that resonate with your play style. Pick these heroes and commit to mastering them, as familiarity will significantly enhance your understanding of the game. Watching educational content, such as gameplay videos or tutorials, can also be invaluable, particularly given that the in-game tutorial primarily prepares players for bot matches rather than PvP scenarios.

Overall, while ""Dota 2"" may present hurdles for new players, those who persevere and take the time to learn will ultimately discover a richly rewarding experience defined by strategy, teamwork, and a constantly evolving meta. The key lies in finding your niche within the game and continuously refining your skills, all while seeking support and guidance from the wealth of resources available online.",True

570,"Every online community has it's toxic trolls. Dota 2, unfortunately has become one of THE most toxic where the matching system pairs you with these kinds of individuals. The overwatch system which reviews behaviour will then punish you when you are taunted by trolls, and will protect trolls that do the taunting. This is just the tip of the iceberg, do yourself a favour and turn around. If you do decide to stay, by no means give them your money. The Dota+ subscription which is supposed to help pair you with other players at your level does not actually work. The coaches that are supposed to help you in game are rarely available. There are no actual in game tips or cues available to make the subscription worth. The analytics they offer for the subscription are worthless because you can play your best and still have 3-4 players on your team that will throw the game. In game purchases are overpriced. The list goes on, so if you do stay, save your pennies, and try not to become another toxic troll.

The only people who are likely to enjoy this game are people who have either played thousands of hours of MOBAs already, or people who's goal isn't actually to play the game but instead want to trash talk in chat. This game has a huge problem with not only bots but also smurfs, and each match is almost guaranteed to be completely one sided, whether it's for or against you, except for at the highest levels of play. If you love MOBAs and don't care how many slurs they call you in chat, then this game may be the best you've ever played, but for the average player I could never recommend it.

Isso faz muita falta, já que o layout original tinha uma disposição perfeita, o que tornava o jogo mais equilibrado e divertido.

Após a mudança no mapa e a adição de algumas mecânicas, como itens dropados por mobs da floresta e o modo Turbo, o jogo perdeu um pouco da sua essência. A inserção desses elementos desnecessários poderia ter ficado para modos de jogo arcade, em vez de impactar a experiência principal.

The initial learning curve is really steep and it takes patience and a lot of thinking to even get to the stage of being able to experience the game for what it is and even then, you can end up with matches where you feel your soul sucked out of your body.

You might be wondering ""That doesn't sound like a thumbs up, then?"" 

Dota is a very good game. This game rewards you for learning it and paying attention to details like nothing else. The heroes are all very unique and serve unique purposes in the macro game. If you understand your build choices and are able to adapt on the fly, you can change the game itself for every other participant. Have that with 10 heroes in a match and you are always coming across some new situation, some new challenge on every game you play. And when you can rise up to that challenge and win with the help of your teamamates, that feeling can be like the most potent drug injected directly into your veins.

The thing is, most of the things that suck about dota come from the people playing it rather than the game itself. With how much influence a single player has, they can ruin the game for everyone just as much as they can make it a unforgettable experience.

Play with friends. Learn the macro game. Then learn the heroes and experiment. That's my advice.

📜 Overview
Dota 2, developed and published by Valve, is one of the most popular and competitive multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games. Released in 2013 as a successor to the original Defense of the Ancients (DotA) mod for Warcraft III, Dota 2 features intense 5v5 strategic battles where teams pick heroes with unique abilities, compete for map control, and aim to destroy the opposing team's Ancient. With deep mechanics, a thriving esports scene, and a dedicated player base, Dota 2 remains a pinnacle of competitive gaming.

⚠️ Cons

Whether you're a casual player or an aspiring esports competitor, Dota 2 is a must-play for fans of strategy-based team games.",True
570,"TLDR: Ends up just being grown men crying and arguing and everyone swears they know more than you so everyone has an opinion about how the game should be played. No one takes responsibility for themselves so they just blame others regardless of its actually their fault or not. Save yourself the headache of this rabbit hole. It just ends up not being fun.

You might have fun learning all the heroes and the mechanics of the game, but you will soon realize there are a bunch of man babies and toxic people who play this game and it makes the whole concept of being on a team and working together irrelevant because there are too many egotistical and delusional players. You might get 1 good game out of 10 and thats being generous. The games are hardly ever balanced because there is always 1 or 2 people that feed the enemy team kills because they are bad at the game, so one enemy player becomes very strong and just owns your team all game, not fun.

Yea learning the game can be fun. But I think you can save yourself time and play a better game with less people complaining and ruining the experience that the game was meant to be.",False

570,"Dota 2 – A Deep, Punishing, and Highly Competitive MOBA
Hours Played: 22.6

Dota 2 is a high-skill, strategy-heavy MOBA that rewards game knowledge, teamwork, and mechanical skill. It’s brutal for newcomers, but for those who stick with it, the depth and strategic possibilities are nearly endless.

The Good
✅ Incredibly Deep Gameplay – Over 120 heroes, thousands of item builds, and infinite strategies.

✅ Completely Free-to-Play – No pay-to-win mechanics—only cosmetics.

✅ High Skill Ceiling – Mastering a single hero can take dozens of hours, but that’s part of the fun.

✅ Epic Comeback Potential – One good team fight can turn the tide of a match.

✅ Regular Updates & Esports Scene – Huge balance patches keep the game fresh, and pro matches are amazing to watch.

The Bad
❌ Steep Learning Curve – Mechanics, items, and hero matchups take time to learn.

❌ Toxicity in Matches – Expect blame, flaming, and rage if things go south.

❌ Long Matches – Games can last 40-60 minutes, and bad matches feel like a slog.

Final Verdict
With 22+ hours, I can say Dota 2 is one of the deepest and most rewarding MOBAs, but it’s not beginner-friendly. If you’re willing to learn and embrace the challenge, it’s one of the best strategy games out there.

Rating: 8/10 – Brutal, strategic, and endlessly deep. ⚔️🔥",True

One thing I don't like - it feels like they change mechanics/map quite often, like roshan tps, aganim shards etc. As I'm more of a casual dota enjoyer last few years, once in a while I want to play dota, but everything changed, new map, new mechanics, people are screaming at you saying you're stupid. Then I leave the game for few months. 
Anyway, dota is dota, it's already a classic. No other Moba will take it's place as THE moba. And I like how this game reveals for me my new qualities I never knew existed. For example, in real life I don't like milfs at all, I like young girls, but when I play dota - I'm ready to have sex with other player's moms. 10/10",True

Dota 2 Review
Introduction
Dota 2, created by Valve, is one of the most popular and competitive multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) titles. Released in 2013, the game features intense team-based strategy, a large number of heroes, and a vibrant player community. Dota 2's deep gameplay mechanics make it a challenging but rewarding experience for both casual and professional players. In this review, we'll look at the gameplay, graphics, sound design, and performance to see what makes it unique in the gaming world.
However, in reality, the developers do not give the players the attention they deserve. Many issues are to blame, including the lack of a way to announce the game's development plan that can be followed, slow game patch updates, and etc.

Gameplay & mechanics
Dota 2 provides a deep and strategic experience in which two teams of five players compete to destroy the opposing Ancient while defending their own. The game includes over 120 distinct heroes, each with their own abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. The mechanics include last-hitting creeps, skilled item use, positioning, teamwork, and advanced tactics such as juking in the fog of war, Low-High Ground, Outplayed + Counterplay, and so on.
The high skill ceiling makes Dota 2 one of the most difficult MOBAs, but it also keeps players interested.  While beginners may struggle with the game's complexity, it does provide tutorials, coaching tools, and AI practice modes to help them improve.  The dynamic gameplay ensures that no two matches are alike, making each one an exciting test of skill and strategy.
 In fact, for new players, this game is very difficult to learn quickly due to the many mechanics of the game, which require a lot of effort, both playing alone and watching the competition.

Graphics and Art Style
 Dota 2 boasts a fantasy-inspired art style that combines detailed hero models, immersive environments, and fluid animation.  Valve has consistently improved the visuals over time, making the game more polished and appealing.

 Each hero has a distinct design that makes them easily identifiable on the battlefield.  The game's day-night cycle, spell effects, and animations enhance its visual appeal, while a variety of cosmetic skins and arcana items allow for customization.  Despite these additions, the game retains its balanced competitive nature, as skins are purely aesthetic.

 The early and later versions' character models differ significantly.  There is a significant positive difference.

Sound and Music
 Dota 2 has excellent sound design, which adds to the game's immersive experience.  Each hero has a distinct voice line, which adds personality and depth to the lore.  The in-game music changes dynamically depending on the flow of the battle, heightening the tension and excitement of matches.

 Sound effects such as ability casts, attacks, and item activations are clear and impactful, providing useful audio cues that allow players to react more quickly.  Furthermore, announcer packs and kill-streak sounds add another layer of customization, allowing players to tailor their experience.

 The in-game sound pack (background sound pack) has numerous records.  I recommend the song for the International 10 event.  It has a beautiful melody.

Performance and Technical Aspects
 Dota 2 runs on the Source 2 engine, which provides smooth performance and excellent optimization across a wide range of hardware configurations.  The game runs well on both low- and high-end PCs, making it accessible to a large number of players.

 Conclusion
 Dota 2 is still one of the best and most challenging MOBAs available.  Its deep strategic gameplay, stunning visuals, immersive sound design, and strong performance set it apart in the esports scene.  Although the game's steep learning curve may intimidate newcomers, those who put in the time to master it will find it endlessly rewarding.
 Personally, this is the best game I've ever played.

570,"[b][u]Matchmaking Mayhem:[/u][/b] The matchmaking system is a complete mess—it routinely pairs players who just reported each other in the previous game. This not only breeds resentment but also perpetuates a toxic cycle of negativity that undermines team cohesion from the very start.

Imagine a scenario where a seasoned 15-year veteran ends up sharing a rank with a complete newcomer simply because the newbie was extraordinarily lucky during their MMR calibration.

570,"Dear Valve,

As a dedicated Meepo player, I would like to express my concerns regarding the recent changes made to Meepo in the latest updates. Meepo is a unique and highly challenging hero in Dota 2, requiring significant skill and practice to master. However, the recent updates have overlooked his core characteristics and introduced changes that feel misguided. Below are my detailed concerns and suggestions for improvement:

Key Concerns
1、Neutral Items in the First 4 Levels:
Meepo’s innate ability is tied to neutral item selection, yet there are no suitable neutral items for him in the first 4 levels. Adding more options without addressing this issue renders the mechanic meaningless.
2、New Shard Design:
The current Shard design lacks the essence of Meepo and offers underwhelming numerical values. In a meta dominated by AOE abilities, these values are negligible and fail to enhance Meepo’s gameplay.
3、Removal of ""Ransack"" Shard:
Deleting the ""Ransack"" Shard was a poor decision. This Shard allowed Meepo to have flexible itemization options, moving away from a rigid stat-building path. It was a well-designed feature that should be reinstated.

4、Level 25 Talents:
Both Level 25 talents are underwhelming. Reducing cast time by 1 second and increasing health by 350 are insignificant at this stage of the game. These talents appear to be hastily added without proper consideration.

5、Community Feedback:
I have gathered feedback from numerous Meepo enthusiasts, and all agree that the ""Ransack"" Shard should be brought back.

Suggestions for Improvement

1、Neutral Items:
Add enchantments to neutral items that provide attributes (Strength, Agility, Intelligence, or All Attributes) to better suit Meepo’s needs.

2、Shard Design:
Reintroduce the ""Ransack"" Shard and replace the ""More Meepos"" Shard, as the latter does not align with Meepo’s playstyle.

3、Level 25 Talents:
Replace ""Reduced Cast Time by 1 Second"" with ""Additional Clone.""
Change ""+350 Health"" to ""Poof Damage Becomes Pure"" or ""Attacks Apply Movement Slow (similar to the old passive slow)"" with a value of 12% per Meepo, stacking.

Conclusion
Meepo is a hero that many of us deeply love and enjoy playing. However, it seems that the recent updates lack a solid understanding of his design and potential. I sincerely hope you will consider these suggestions to improve the hero and make him more enjoyable for dedicated players.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,
A Meepo Enthusiast",False
570,"Wanted to learn how to play this, but the playerbase is overwhelmingly toxic. Everyone either blasts you with insults or straight up leaves in the middle of the game. So there is way to learn how to play unless you are willing to undergo hours of this on repeat, making the experience really unejoyable. Shame tho.",False
570,"This game has the sickest community among all games i know. I played it for 11 years. Since 2020-2022 this game is flooded with crackheads and anime degenerates who form a hive mind of thousands of people who speak and act like 1 person. I don't know how Dota became what it is now, but even 2 hours of this is unbearable. For the record, i have 11500 behaviour rate out of maximum 12000. Don't play this game if you think you deserve human rights. 

Also this game has forced and hidden 50/50 system where mathcmaking will make you lose by any cost if you won a lot, and will make you win even with closed eyes if you had a big loss streak. Anyone familiar with psychology knows that emotional rollercoaster is a very dirty manipulation tactic.",False
570,"Dota is the best MOBA on the market, in my opinion. The visual identity holds true to modern expectations even to this day, after so many years while the the game play is unique and fun and with skilled mechanics to master at the forefront of it all. Truly outstanding.

The bad part is that the game is filled with smurfs, while Valve themselves declared it illegal to smurf and banning smurfs from time to time, only for the smurfs to buy new accounts and go at it again like nothing really happened. This is mind boggling as surely a company such as Valve with access to information such as you email address, PC, IP, MAC address, PC component ID's and many more behavioral and game play patterns, could know if the same person who uses account A is also using account B to smurf. I'm guessing they either don't have proper detection mechanisms in place, or they just declare war on smurfs only to let them freely play the game.
Anyhow, if you are in for a battle of nervs, go ahead and download DOTA 2. I'm sure you will have fun and also get pissed off (or on, pun intended) by the smurfs.

570,"The game is fun and complex enough to keep you invested for the long run, and all the heroes are free, however the game has a huge drawback, and the main reason why I would never recommend this game to anyone is its community. In my experience, Dota 2 has by far the most toxic community of any other. You more often than not have a better experience with communication muted outside of your party. The problem is you are now at a disadvantage because this game requires team coordination for effective plays, so if the enemy team is talking and yours is not, it will be likelier for you to lose. It's quite a problem without any solution, except as mentioned, muting communication outside of your party and just trying your best. Either way you're probably going to do better without having someone cursing through a microphone.",False

I was a Warcraft 3 player back in the day. I spent most of my time playing custom maps. Like sheep tag, EVOLVES, LOAP, TD, etc... It was the first time in my gaming career that I sat down to play before bedtime and was surprised at the sun rising in the early morning. The Defense of the Ancients All-Stars map was a game that mildly interested me, but I ended up becoming annoyed when the custom map server browser became inundated with DOTA lobbies and destroyed part of the vibrant ecosystem of new and creative maps the community was building.

This continues on even today. DOTA 2 has a custom map function as well, but most of the commonly played maps seem to be DOTA variations and the recreations of excellent Warcraft 3 custom maps go primarily unplayed. Personally I consider this problematic. We used to be a community of gamers who played a variety of games and enjoyed exploring the possibilities, now we have people who only play particular live service games and never expand their horizons with new experiences.

570,"[h1]Dota 2 – The King of MOBAs[/h1]

Overall Rating: ★★★★☆

Dota 2, developed by Valve, is one of the most complex and rewarding multiplayer games ever created. As a free-to-play MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena), it offers deep strategy, intense competition, and nearly endless replayability. With over 120 heroes, constant updates, and a thriving esports scene, Dota 2 remains a top-tier competitive game.

Gameplay & Depth: ★★★★★

At its core, Dota 2 is all about strategy, teamwork, and mechanical skill. Matches typically last 30–60 minutes, requiring precise execution and decision-making. Every hero has unique abilities, and item builds can drastically change their playstyle. No two games feel the same, making it one of the deepest competitive experiences in gaming.

Balance & Updates: ★★★★☆

Valve frequently updates the game with hero reworks, new items, and balance changes. While the meta constantly shifts, some updates introduce overpowered heroes, leading to balance issues. However, Valve’s commitment to refining the game keeps it fresh and competitive.

Matchmaking & Community: ★★★☆☆

Matchmaking can be hit-or-miss, especially in ranked play. Toxicity is a common issue, as Dota 2 has a notoriously tough community. New players often struggle due to the game’s steep learning curve, though tools like the in-game coaching system help ease the process.

Graphics & Performance: ★★★★☆

Visually, Dota 2 is polished, with detailed hero models and vibrant environments. The Source 2 engine ensures smooth performance, even on lower-end PCs. Occasional server issues and lag spikes can be frustrating, but they don’t significantly impact the experience.

Esports & Competitive Scene: ★★★★★

The Dota 2 esports scene is one of the biggest in gaming, with The International offering record-breaking prize pools. Watching pro matches is an exciting experience, and the in-game spectator tools make it easy for players to follow high-level play.

Overall Verdict:

Dota 2 is a masterpiece of competitive gaming, offering unmatched strategic depth and thrilling team-based battles. While its steep learning curve and sometimes frustrating community can be barriers, those who invest time into the game will find one of the most rewarding experiences in online gaming.",True

570,"Dota 2 is like trying to solve a Rubik’s Cube while riding a rollercoaster—blindfolded. It’s a game where you’ll spend 40 minutes strategizing, coordinating, and outplaying your opponents, only to lose because someone accidentally clicked the wrong item or fed the enemy carry *one too many times*. The learning curve isn’t just steep; it’s a vertical cliff with no ropes, and the tutorial is basically the community yelling “git gud” at you. But hey, once you get the hang of it, there’s nothing more satisfying than landing a perfect Black Hole or pulling off a game-winning play. Just don’t get too attached to your MMR—it’s a fickle beast that giveth and taketh away with no mercy. Dota 2 is a masterpiece of chaos, salt, and occasional brilliance, where every match feels like a soap opera with way too many plot twists. Whether you’re a casual player or a tryhard, one thing’s for sure: you’ll either love it or swear it off forever (until you queue up again tomorrow).",True

570,"Alright, let's dive into the chaotic world of Dota 2, where dreams are made, and friendships are broken faster than you can say ""GG.""

Gameplay: Ah, Dota 2, the game that takes ""easy to learn, hard to master"" and cranks it up to ""impossible to learn, soul-crushing to master."" The gameplay is a dizzying ballet of strategy, reflexes, and sheer dumb luck. With over 100 heroes to choose from, each with their own unique abilities, you'll spend more time figuring out who does what than actually playing the game. And let's not forget the joy of being flamed by your teammates for not knowing the intricate mechanics of denying creeps or stacking camps. But hey, when you finally pull off that perfect combo and wipe the enemy team, it's like hitting the jackpot in a casino—pure, unadulterated euphoria.

Design: Valve's artists deserve a standing ovation for making a game that's both visually stunning and utterly incomprehensible. The crisp, readable style ensures that you can almost tell what's happening in those chaotic 5v5 brawls. Almost. The map is a work of art, with its lush jungles, treacherous rivers, and strategically placed towers that will shred you to pieces if you so much as look at them funny. And let's not forget the heroes themselves, each one a beautifully designed bundle of nightmares and frustration.

Critique: Now, let's get to the fun part—tearing it apart. Dota 2's learning curve isn't just steep; it's a vertical cliff face covered in grease. New players are thrown into the deep end with a cinder block tied to their ankles, left to flounder and drown in a sea of mechanics and jargon. The community, bless their hearts, is about as welcoming as a nest of vipers. Expect to be told you suck more times than you can count. And the matchmaking system? It's like a sadistic game of Russian roulette, where you're just as likely to be paired with a team of pros as you are with a bunch of headless chickens.

In conclusion, Dota 2 is a beautifully crafted, endlessly frustrating masterpiece. It's a game that will test your patience, your sanity, and your ability to withstand verbal abuse from strangers on the internet. But for those who persevere, it's a rewarding experience like no other. Just remember to take breaks, breathe, and maybe keep a stress ball handy. You'll need it.",True

Pros:

Engaging gameplay: If you enjoy watching your teammate manage to lose the game in 10 seconds, then this is your game.

Diverse heroes: You can choose from a hundred characters, each with unique abilities that you'll never master.

Tournaments: Watch pros play and wonder why you can't even win a public match.

Cons:

Complexity: If you think you can master the game in a week, you're wrong. It'll take you a year to realize you still don't understand it.

Ranking system: It's like trying to catch a train that left without you.

570,"As a long time player of this game it has helped me get through a lot of awful situations. It's something to distract and keep you busy. It has a lot of issues that the devs refuse to deal with. Patches are often unbalanced and devs will let heros stay strong for a very long time. They play favorites with heros(Tiny,spec , etc) where they will be meta in every single patch for actual years with out solving the issue or nerfing them in any meaningful way.  Between Dev Bias and throwing half thought out  patches onto the players and making the player base test the patches is extremely lazy from a dev standpoint.  

Plus the player base is just toxic the devs do very little to fix it they have always had a hands off approach and it shows. You can have literal 30-40 year olds have a mental break down because you decide to play a hero they don't like. It's quite insane to see the mental sink this game really is. 

There attempts to fix any of these issues or deal with them are negligible at best and uncaring at worse.

570,"Dota 2 has a special place in my gaming heart, and it's not just because it’s one of the most popular MOBAs (Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas) in the world, but because it offers an experience like no other. Here are some of the reasons why I’m so drawn to the game:

1. Deep and Strategic Gameplay

What sets Dota 2 apart from other games is its incredible depth. Every match feels unique, and there are always new strategies to explore. With over 100 heroes, each with its own set of abilities, learning how to utilize each hero to its maximum potential keeps things fresh. Whether I’m playing support, carry, or in the offlane, the strategic choices feel vast and rewarding.

2. Constantly Evolving Meta

One of the reasons Dota 2 never feels stale is the ever-evolving meta. Valve regularly releases patches, changing hero strengths, item builds, and more. This constant balance ensures that no one strategy stays dominant for too long, and it keeps the game feeling new and exciting. I love that I’m never truly ""done"" learning.

3. The Thrill of Team Play

Dota 2 is not a solo experience; it’s a game built around teamwork and cooperation. The synergy between heroes and the way you can win or lose based on team coordination is a huge part of the appeal. The excitement of executing a perfect team fight, or the tension of defending your base in the late game, keeps my adrenaline pumping. It feels like a shared journey with friends (or sometimes even strangers) towards victory.

4. High Skill Ceiling

One of the things that keeps me coming back to Dota 2 is its high skill ceiling. The game has a lot of room for growth, and you can always improve. Whether it’s learning more advanced mechanics like creep stacking or improving your map awareness, the feeling of personal improvement over time is so satisfying. The sense of accomplishment when I pull off a difficult play, like a game-changing Roshan steal or a perfect initiation, is unmatched.

5. Epic Matches and Tournaments

The intensity of Dota 2 matches, especially in the late game, is something that can't be found in many other games. The back-and-forth, nail-biting action as teams try to push for the final win is always captivating. Plus, Dota 2’s competitive scene is massive, with The International (TI) being one of the most exciting and prestigious tournaments in all of esports. Watching professional players execute high-level strategies and mechanics makes me appreciate the game even more.

6. The Community and Customization

While Dota 2’s community can be challenging at times, it’s also filled with passionate players who really love the game. I’ve found that playing with like-minded people who are all in for the strategy and excitement makes the experience all the more rewarding. Plus, the game’s customization options—whether through skins, announcer packs, or loading screens—let me personalize my experience and make it my own.

7. Free-to-Play Accessibility

Another reason I love Dota 2 is its free-to-play model. Unlike other competitive games, I don’t need to pay for new heroes or content. Everyone starts on equal footing, which creates a truly fair playing field for both new players and veterans alike.

Dota 2 has so much to offer, and its complexity, strategic depth, and sheer excitement keep me coming back for more. It’s a game where no two matches are the same, and every win or loss feels earned. If you love competitive gaming with deep mechanics, there’s no other experience quite like it.

570,this game is a masterpiece it destroyed my life completely,True
570,"I am uncertain if I play this game of my own free will.
10/10",True
570,"Dota is gone… Solo ranked is complete trash, just a river of crying. 90% of the communication is people whining that something isn't going their way or that someone made a mistake. You can be skilled, play a ton of heroes well, but there will always be some garbage player who, instead of defending the Ancient (DEFENSE OF THE ANCIENT!!!) in the 50th minute, after feeding the enemy team, decides to grief in the jungle even when the game is still winnable.
And then this clown, on top of throwing the game, hands out reports to teammates and wishes cancer upon their families because he played like an absolute loser. These reports land you in a cesspool of players where azbuka dominates, accompanied by gameplay with the IQ of a donkey. These players are literally the cancer of this game, like a Venomancer mid going 0-8 in 10 minutes, so only about 1 in 10 games is actually playable.
These useless trash players have only one skill: spamming reports. The only way out of this hellhole is to find a group of people to boost your communication score. But if you're addicted to playing, you just suffer through these games with losers, constantly getting reported, sometimes for the dumbest reasons. Like playing support, going to pull a camp, and then Олег(Oleg), useless azbuka dog, the Pos1 Anti-Mage, dies like a noob (ending with a final score of 0-11, obviously) and then spends the rest of the game spamming azbuka in chat instead of playing.
There are games that are worth it, but is the suffering really worth it? After so many years in Dota, quitting is just not an option anymore. I have saint-like patience, but I would love to lend my account to the masterminds behind this matchmaking and have them play it for a week straight. I’d love to see how much fun they would have.",False

570,"Dota 2, developed by Valve, is one of the most competitive and complex multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games in the world. With deep strategic gameplay, a massive hero pool, and a thriving esports scene, Dota 2 offers an unparalleled experience for players who love intense, skill-based battles.

Positive Aspects:
✅ Deep and Strategic Gameplay – With over 120 heroes, countless item builds, and ever-evolving strategies, every match feels unique and rewarding for players who master the game.

✅ Completely Free-to-Play – Unlike many other games, Dota 2 gives players access to all heroes from the start, making it fair and balanced without pay-to-win mechanics.

✅ Thriving Esports Scene – With The International offering some of the biggest prize pools in esports history, Dota 2 remains one of the most exciting games to watch and play competitively.

✅ Constant Updates and Balancing – Valve regularly updates the game with new heroes, balance changes, and seasonal events, keeping the meta fresh and engaging.

✅ Incredible Depth and Replayability – No two matches are ever the same due to the complexity of hero interactions, team compositions, and in-game decisions.

Negative Aspects:
❌ Steep Learning Curve – Dota 2 is notoriously difficult for beginners, requiring hundreds of hours to truly understand its mechanics, making it intimidating for new players.

❌ Toxic Community – Like many competitive online games, Dota 2 has a reputation for toxicity, especially in ranked matches where communication can be aggressive.

❌ Matches Can Be Long and Frustrating – Games often last between 30-60 minutes, and a single mistake can cost the match, making losses especially frustrating.

Final Verdict:
Dota 2 is a masterpiece for strategy and competitive gaming fans, offering unmatched depth and an ever-evolving experience. However, its steep learning curve and intense matches might not be for everyone. If you’re willing to invest the time, Dota 2 provides one of the most rewarding multiplayer experiences in gaming. ⚔️🔥",True

The real problem is the automatic penalty system they have.
I came from LOL and in the begning i tried to skip two battles cause in lol if you do 2 times you get a 30 min ban and ok but NOT HERE.
Some genius thought would be a good idea punish beginners to single draft so they are bound to play heros they don't want to and in positions they don't want to and put them in low priority. So this turn to be waiting lines of 30min in LATAM and you have to win 3 times, so this is a 10 hours punishment that you have to go through. Yeah, not sure who gave this idea but man... that is an exclent idea to ruin a game for new players and get income for your game (Not sure if you guys heard from RIOT but new players are the guys who spend money on you).

730,"Counter-Strike 2 is the long-awaited upgrade to one of the most iconic FPS games in history. Built on the Source 2 engine, it brings improved graphics, enhanced responsiveness, and a reworked smoke grenade system that adds more tactical depth. But does it truly feel like a step forward?

Pros:
✅ Visual & Performance Upgrade: The move to Source 2 provides crisper visuals, better lighting, and improved physics, making the game feel more modern while retaining its classic style.
✅ Responsive Gameplay: CS2 maintains the tight, skill-based mechanics that make Counter-Strike a masterpiece in competitive shooters.
✅ New Smoke Mechanics: Dynamic smoke grenades that interact with bullets and explosions add fresh strategic possibilities.
✅ Free Upgrade for CS:GO Players: If you owned CS:GO, you get CS2 for free—so there's no risk in trying it out.

Cons:
❌ Missing Features: Some beloved features from CS:GO (like certain maps, modes, and community servers) are still absent.
❌ Hit Reg & Subtick System Issues: While the new subtick update system aims to improve responsiveness, some players have reported inconsistencies in hit registration.
❌❌ Balancing & Anti-Cheat: Cheating remains an issue, and certain weapon balances could still use fine-tuning.
❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌
FINAL !!!! 
Counter-Strike 2 is a solid evolution rather than a revolution. It brings necessary updates to a legendary game but still feels like a work in progress. If you're a long-time fan, it's worth playing, but if you're expecting a groundbreaking experience, you might be slightly disappointed. That said, with continued updates and community feedback, CS2 has the potential to become just as beloved as its predecessor.

730,"Counter-Strike 2: A Masterclass in Downgrades

Ah, Counter-Strike 2. The long-awaited, heavily hyped, Source 2-powered evolution of the greatest tactical shooter of all time. And what did we get? A broken mess that makes you appreciate Counter-Strike: Global Offensive—a game we all spent years complaining about.

First, let's talk about the servers. You ever wanted to experience what it’s like to time travel? Well, now you can! Thanks to CS2’s incredible sub-tick system, every gunfight feels like you're guessing where the past version of your opponent might be, while the future version of yourself is already dead. Laggy peeks, input delay, and rubberbanding galore—it’s like Valve found the worst possible way to implement online gameplay and ran with it.

Then, we have the cheaters. Oh boy. If you ever dreamed of playing against professional aimlock enthusiasts in every second game, CS2 has you covered. The VAC system? Think of it as a museum piece—nice to look at but completely useless. Mass reporting doesn’t work, the cheaters never get banned, and somehow, they always win. It's almost impressive.

But don’t worry, CS2 did bring improvements! They gave us volumetric smokes—because that’s what everyone wanted, right? Not better matchmaking, not reliable hit registration, but dynamic, 3D smokes that look cool while you get shot through them by someone using wallhacks.

Meanwhile, Valorant exists, a game that actually runs well, has anti-cheat that does something, and doesn’t make you question if your bullets are real or just imaginary suggestions to the game engine.

Overall, Counter-Strike 2 is like getting a birthday gift from Valve where they take away your old toy and give you a newer, shinier, but completely broken version of it. 0/10 experience when playing, 10/10 experience when uninstalling.",False
730,"no content, cheaters in almost every game, 'what you see is what you get' is a joke.
it's a waste of time. I should have realised earlier. :(",False
730,"There are too many cheaters, and Valve can't find any solution. Why aren't hardware bans applied to players detected using cheats? A cheater has to get caught in Overwatch, receive a cheating conviction, and get their account banned. Then, they'll just buy another prime account for a few bucks and continue ruining our games. Since Valve isn't addressing this issue, every player over 30 that I've talked to believes Valve itself is the one releasing these cheats. Until Valve finds a definitive solution to cheating, all non-cheating CS2 players should boycott Valve.",False
730,"Worst version of CS. valve developers can't make good games. Cs:go wasn't made by valve(it was founded by another company). CS:S was downgrade compare to cs 1.6. Cheaters everywhere, farming bots, radarhackers and matchfixers in a pro scene, bad network, horrible sub-tick, bad optimization, toxic low iq community, skin slots without age restriction. VAC doesn't exist at this point. I would rather play CS Classic and it will be better than this clown-fiesta.",False

730,"No i can't in good faith recommend this game, its everything wrong with valve encapsulated in a shitty product which you can feel in this neglected shit pile. filled with cheaters, scammers and other general shittery allowed to fester so valve can keep this gravy train running. 

What? A hacker joins your game and stomps you during a ranked or premier match? skill issue you lose points and even if the cheater gets banned which rarely happens they'll just buy a new account and start over again which causes people to get tired of this and then smurf in lower ranks making the game worse for everybody.

That's not even getting into the amount of scammers that you meet on an individual basis that will randomly add you act like your friend and pilfer your account in ever evolving new ways, while valve has a policy of no support if your scammed no refund, no emergency trade reset. Nothing. You can report the account but that wont get your shit back and valves solution is dump more money back into the system that fucks you, with shitty game sponsored gambling in a game with no checks to protect consumers from these practices and sites that develop around them.

Then finally to top it off these problems aren't unique to CS2 they also existed in CSGO ! And what did we gain from the switch? same issues even less content, content that comes out at a slower pace with less shit in it apart from more skins that do nothing to improve the game and for what? 

More money whilst the game rots, only propped up by its only addicting features the moment to moment game play and the ability to potentially make money all do to distract you that you're playing a game with a decades old formula while in the long term potentially paying more for less content and community and instead replacing it with more chances to make money.",False

At first you laugh it off and know you are new.  After that, you just get pretty angry.  Eventually after a few hundred hours you reach the breaking point, and you enter disbelief that it is possible to play a video game so poorly, and you are fucking done and you just leave matches, quit, or otherwise throw in the towel.  Your blood pressure rises and its just different levels of fury and disappointment.  But the bad part is that not long after, you get that itch again.  Either from yourself of from your party bros, you decide to hop on again, thinking about a nice juicy win streak, some nice nades, some heavenly headshots and frags.  In reality, you lose 4 matches in a row, you question your chices and sanity, and you want to end it all.  You type quit smoking in the console, and then you get called a retard meanwhile you are trapped in low elo, csgo shit hell.  Basically, this cycle of doing bad, getting angry, then just being dissapointed, and then itching to play again continues till all you can play is cs2.  Anyway even if you somehow escape the wrath, they bring you back with the itch to have to hoard and buy all of the virtual pixels and skins on the screen.  I fucking hate this game, i wish i had never played it a few years ago, and I will never ever get my time on this game back.  I am tired of retards, cheaters, and people who you could convince me are bots because they play worse than the local nursing home.

Each round feels like a new challenge, with constant adaptation to the unpredictable nature of the game, whether it's the map layout or the tactics your opponents use.

The range of maps, weapons, and gameplay modes keeps things fresh, and each match has its own unpredictable narrative.

🚨 Cheating Epidemic

The anti-cheat system (VAC) is completely broken. Every other game is infested with blatant cheaters — wallhacks, aimlocks, you name it. Mass reporting does nothing, and it’s painfully obvious that the system is either not working or not being monitored properly. Meanwhile, competitors like Valorant have managed to create far more effective anti-cheat systems — so why hasn’t Valve? If a free-to-play game is going to survive, anti-cheat HAS to be a priority.

🌍 Toxic Environment and Trolls

The community is more toxic than ever. Every match seems to have at least one griefer or troll ruining the experience for everyone else — and yet, no meaningful moderation exists. The vote kick system is abused constantly, and players using racial slurs or griefing matches face no real consequences. There’s no accountability, no consequences — and it shows.

🎯 Broken Matchmaking and Hit Registration

The sub-tick system has made the gameplay feel inconsistent and unreliable. You can shoot first and still die. Peeking feels like a gamble, and hit registration is frustratingly inconsistent. High ping abusers and regional matchmaking issues only make things worse.

💀 Valve — Fix Your Game

Counter-Strike is too important to the FPS world to be left in this state. The player base deserves a working anti-cheat, better matchmaking, and actual consequences for toxicity and cheating. Valve needs to take these issues seriously — otherwise, players will continue migrating to other games that actually care about the competitive experience.

CS2 has solid gameplay, but the cheating problem makes it almost unplayable. VAC is useless—nearly every match has blatant or closet cheaters.

But the biggest problem is the lack of anti cheat, and the amount of cheaters in the game. Almost every single premier game has either one or multiple cheaters, and it just completely destroys the experience for the rest of us.

730,"Performance and Optimization Nightmare ""our cs2 experience""
When Counter-Strike 2 was first teased, there were high hopes. The game was supposed to be more ""next-gen,"" with improved graphics, smoother gameplay, and advanced technology that should’ve pushed the franchise into the future. Unfortunately, what we got instead feels like a rushed, undercooked product. Even with a top-tier gaming PC—one that comfortably runs CS:GO at high frame rates—I’m seeing Counter-Strike 2 stutter and lag. It’s as if the game is trying to push something it’s not ready for. FPS drops occur regularly, and the frame rates plummet during high-intensity moments, something that simply wasn’t an issue in its predecessor. The optimization is absolutely terrible.

To make matters worse, there’s an issue with how the game allocates resources. I’ve seen instances where my GPU usage is well below 60%, and my CPU spikes, all while the game stutters to keep up. The result? A frustrating, broken experience where you’re constantly fighting against the game's inherent performance flaws. That might be something you can tolerate in an early beta, but this is the full release, and it's completely inexcusable. It doesn’t matter if you’ve got an RTX 3090 or the latest Intel chip, the game will make you feel like you’re playing on an ancient machine.

Inconsistent Hit Registration and Broken Mechanics
Counter-Strike has always been about precision and skill. A large part of its charm comes from that skill-based combat, where landing shots is directly tied to your aim and timing. But with Counter-Strike 2, the game has broken that core principle.

The so-called “sub-tick” system is a mess. For those who aren’t familiar, this was introduced as a way to improve server tick rates and reduce lag-related issues. Instead of improving things, it has made hit registration feel wildly inconsistent. I’ll be facing an enemy at close range, unload an entire magazine, only to see my shots whiff completely. There’s a delay between the time I pull the trigger and when the shots actually register, and this isn’t just occasional—it’s constant.

You’ll find yourself dying around corners where you’re certain you had the angle, or getting one-tapped by enemies whose bullets seem to bend through walls. It’s not just frustrating, it’s completely maddening. The fundamental mechanics that once made the series great are in shambles. What’s the point of precision aiming when the game itself can’t get the basics right?

Cheating Epidemic: A Competitive Nightmare
One of the most frustrating things about Counter-Strike 2 is the fact that Valve has somehow failed to address the cheating problem in any meaningful way. Aimbots, wallhacks, speed hacks, you name it—cheaters are running rampant in this game, and there’s no real effort to stem the tide.

I’ve spent more time in matches recently reporting players than actually enjoying the game. And even when you do report someone, there’s no guarantee anything will be done about it. Valve’s anti-cheat system feels like a joke, especially when you encounter blatant cheaters who have no fear of being caught. It’s ruining the game’s competitive integrity. What’s the point of trying to be good at a game when your opponents can essentially toggle on god-mode cheats and you’re left helpless?

It’s so bad that I’ve been in matches where cheaters completely dominate, and no one can do anything about it. It destroys the fun of playing competitively. It’s all the more upsetting because Counter-Strike used to be a title where competitive fairness was sacred. Now, it feels like a free-for-all, where cheating is normalized and punished rarely—if at all.

Content Removal: The Soul of Counter-Strike is Gone
One of the biggest slaps in the face to longtime fans is the removal of classic content and game modes. Gone are the beloved modes like Arms Race and Danger Zone, which added variety and fun to the game when you wanted a break from competitive matches. These modes helped flesh out CS:GO, offering something different when the typical 5v5 match just didn’t cut it. Now, with Counter-Strike 2, those modes are mysteriously absent, leaving a void that no amount of new skins or maps can fill.

On top of that, the removal of support for macOS was a baffling decision. Many players in the community, including myself, used to play on Macs, and this sudden exclusion has left a large portion of the fanbase unable to even play the game. For a game that has prided itself on being accessible, this is a huge step back.

Lack of Communication and Developer Inaction
Valve's silence is deafening. The community has voiced its concerns repeatedly, yet the developers have remained almost entirely mute. No clear updates, no explanations for why the game is in the state it’s in—just radio silence. Players are being left in the dark, wondering whether Valve even cares about fixing the game or if they’re just going to move on to the next big title.

This lack of communication has only fueled the anger within the community. We’ve seen them take months to address even the most basic issues, and the fear that Counter-Strike 2 will continue to be neglected is growing every day. The franchise has always had a strong relationship with its fanbase, but that’s rapidly eroding as Valve continues to push out half-baked updates and ignores player feedback.

The State of the Community
Perhaps one of the most disheartening aspects of Counter-Strike 2 is the state of its community. The game has become a toxic wasteland, with constant cheating, connection issues, and poor matchmaking experiences. The player base is frustrated and demoralized, and it shows in how people behave during matches. Once, the competitive nature of CS brought out the best in players, creating an environment of skill and camaraderie. Now, it’s all about getting through the match without tearing your hair out.

The introduction of the new matchmaking system has only made things worse. The rankings feel inconsistent, and there are so many smurf accounts—players intentionally playing at lower levels to dominate newbies—that it’s impossible to climb without running into wall after wall. It’s made the competitive scene feel pointless, with no real progression.

In Conclusion: A Franchise in Decline
After hundreds, maybe thousands of hours spent in the Counter-Strike series, I never thought I’d be here, completely disillusioned and frustrated with the state of the game. Counter-Strike 2 has taken everything that made the franchise great and run it into the ground. What was supposed to be a promising evolution of the series has instead resulted in an unoptimized, broken, and increasingly unpopular title.

It’s hard to recommend the game to anyone anymore. I still have hope that Valve will turn things around, but with each passing update, it feels more like they’re ignoring the core issues that the community is pleading for them to address. Until that happens, Counter-Strike 2 remains an absolute disaster of a release—unplayable, unbalanced, and unrecognizable as the game we all loved.",False

730,"[h1]Honest CS2 Review from a player with a combined 10 years of CS experience, across all games. Yes, even Nexon.[/h1]

CS2 is.... so god damn bittersweet to play. The graphics and particles, are amazing. Truly something I would've only dreamed of when I was an 11 year old boy and played CS:GO for the first time. The skins look better than ever with this new revamped lighting, and it's easier than ever to get into the game.

[h2]The new and ""improved"" ranking system[/h2] 

To call this system improved is... a half truth. Yes, it's more specific to maps, but also makes it EXTREMELY difficult to truly keep track of your skill level, unless you exclusively play premier. This also kinda segues into my issue with the SBMM in normal competitive mode, as if ONE person on your team is Gold Nova on that map, and the rest of you are unranked or Silver 1, the odds of the enemy team having multiple players matching your most powerful player's skill level is very high. 

[h2]The bugs. Dear Christ, the bugs.[/h2]

Where in the name of Christ do I start? For every bug fixed from CS:GO, 2 more appear in this game. Sure, most of them get patched quickly, but the ones that stay are absolutely foul. It's not uncommon for your game to get stuck in the ""CT Side"" or ""T Side"" opening cutscene, rendering you useless until you rejoin the match. 

WHICH, leads me to the next point. Sometimes, (more often than not) should you have to rejoin a competitive or premier match, clicking ""reconnect"" has a very high chance of registering your click, starting the loading timer, but not loading you in. It will seriously sit there and count for the entirety of your re-join timer, at which point it will give you an abandonment cooldown. This can only be fixed by restarting your entire game and trying to connect again, BEFORE THE TIMER RUNS OUT, or very quickly cancelling the load by leaving the party, and clicking ""reconnect"" again.

 [h2]Bots. All the bots. More robots than an unmanned assembly line up in here.[/h2] 

Whether you join a casual match and find a bot-farm match, kicking you almost immediately, or you have someone on your comp queue that has an autoclicker simply to avoid an idling kick so they can farm XP, there is no shortage of bots in this game unless you're full-stacked in a competitive gamemode, or you avoid Deathmatch, Casual, and Arms Race altogether outside of private matches. Admittedly, this problem has lessened in the past couple months. 

 [h3]Summary[/h3]

Despite my harsh words about the game, I think most of it's downfalls can be attributed to it's somewhat rushed release. If this game wasn't damn near Cyberpunk level rushed, I doubt I'd have much to talk about here. All in all, it's still the same old CS you know and love if you're looking for a competitive FPS game to kill time with some friends and hear users from around the world call you slurs you've never even heard of. If you can look past the ""quirks"" and enjoy the new features and GORGEOUS new lighting, you'll have a blast. If fancy lighting and smoother utility sprites can't hold you over, don't install it.",True

Movement and shooting remain awkward and unresponsive, bunny-hopping is inconsistent to the point of impossible, the physics are questionable (why do I still rubber-band when I collide with a teammate?), and no maps have been added to the competitive pool that we haven't seen before.

With regards to matchmaking, it is an unplayable experience with coin flip cheater games at 25k ELO and above, and no VAC/VACNET improvements in sight.

And the most crucial element to the CS zeitgeist, community servers, has been taken out to the proverbial woodshed by having an in-game community server browser that is objectively WORSE than what CSGO had. Furthermore, the lack of an official API has degraded the quality of custom maps and servers such as KZ and surf, gamemodes that started 20 years ago with CS 1.6 and were present in every previous game, are now dead.

It's that little voice in your head whispering, ""What if you're the chosen one?"" — like some kind of divine force is guiding your broke a$$ to financial freedom through a rigged slot machine called ""Lucky Leprechaun Megaways."" The fun isn't even about winning — it's the five-second fantasy before the result hits. That moment where your whole life flashes before your eyes, imagining the casino calling you sir and not just another dumbahh funding their electricity bill.

You don't even need to hit big — a little win will have you out here feeling like the Wolf of Wall Street off a $10 profit. Then the casino reels you in, lets you taste heaven before slapping you back to reality with three empty spins in a row. But you keep going, because the next spin might just be The One. You know it's rigged, you know the house always wins, but your brain doesn't care. It’s all dopamine and delusion, baby.

What's worse is the more you lose, the funnier it gets. That self-aware, broke man laughter when you're down to your last $5, betting it all on some cartoon fruit slot like your ancestors didn't fight wars for this. And when you inevitably lose, you reload your balance while mumbling, ""Just one more deposit, I'm actually feeling lucky this time.""

Gambling is bad for your wallet, your mental health, and probably your whole bloodline — but holy shiii, the ride is immaculate. Nothing makes you feel more alive than losing money you didn't even have in the first place.

730,"Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) is the highly anticipated upgrade to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO), developed by Valve. Running on the Source 2 engine, CS2 brings visual improvements, better responsiveness, and new gameplay mechanics while maintaining the core tactical shooter experience that has defined the franchise for years.

Positive Aspects:
✅ Enhanced Graphics and Visual Effects – With improved lighting, textures, and realistic smoke grenades, CS2 looks significantly better than CS:GO while still running smoothly.

✅ Same Classic, Addictive Gameplay – The core gunplay and tactical elements remain intact, ensuring CS2 retains the fast-paced, skill-based experience that fans love.

✅ Updated Smoke Mechanics – The new volumetric smokes react dynamically to bullets and grenades, adding fresh tactical depth to matches.

✅ Better Performance and Tick Rate – The game features a new sub-tick system, making movement and shooting more responsive compared to CS:GO.

✅ Free Upgrade for CS:GO Players – Since CS2 replaces CS:GO, existing players get access to the new game without additional cost.

Negative Aspects:
❌ Limited Features at Launch – Some popular features from CS:GO, like game modes and maps, were initially missing or limited in CS2, frustrating long-time players.

❌ Hit Registration and Tick Rate Concerns – While the new tick system is designed to improve gameplay, some players report inconsistent hit registration and performance issues.

❌ Adjustments to Movement and Gunplay – The slightly altered movement and recoil mechanics feel different from CS:GO, leading to a learning curve for veteran players.

Final Verdict:
Counter-Strike 2 is a visually and mechanically refined upgrade to CS:GO, offering improved graphics and fresh gameplay elements while staying true to its tactical shooter roots. However, with missing features and some performance inconsistencies at launch, it still has room for improvement. If you're a Counter-Strike fan, CS2 is definitely worth playing, but expect some growing pains as Valve continues to refine the experience. 🎯🔥",True

CS2 has come a long way since launch. While CS:GO felt better initially, Valve is improving CS2 fast, and it’s getting better with every update.

Sub-tick system? Feels more responsive now.
New smokes & grenade physics? Best change in the game.
Gunplay & hit reg? Different, but I’m getting used to it.
Graphics & UI? 100% better than CS:GO.
Performance? Runs great, and I don’t even have a gaming PC.
Matchmaking? Fair 80% of the time, but could improve.
Cheaters? Still there, but not too often—feels the same as before.
Maps? Great updates, but please bring back Cache!
Overall, CS2 is on the right track. With more updates, it could surpass CS:GO completely.

730,"[h1] Steam Review of Counter-Strike 2 - By Sir Winston Churchill [/h1]

My dear comrades of the digital battlefield, I must declare, with all the certainty of a well-placed AWP shot, that Counter-Strike 2 is a most exhilarating and marvelous engagement of skill, strategy, and sheer unrelenting chaos.

From the very moment one steps foot upon the sacred grounds of Dust2 or ventures into the shadowy corners of Inferno, a most peculiar sensation arises—one of both supreme exhilaration and inevitable frustration. For indeed, in the realm of Counter-Strike, glory and despair walk hand in hand, much like an eco round and an overconfident rush into certain doom.

The bugs? The glitches? Oh, my dear allies, they are but the charming imperfections of a war-torn veteran, scars upon a battlefield that has stood the test of time. They do not hinder the experience but rather enhance it—each unexpected physics mishap, each lag-spike disaster, a new chapter in the annals of Counter-Strike history. And as for the hackers and the wallers? They are the natural opposition, the ever-present force that, while loathed, serves as a most excellent antagonist in our collective struggle.

Yet, despite the odds, we fight on! For no matter where you hail from—be it the rolling hills of England, the frozen steppes of Russia, or the sunlit coasts of Brazil—every man and woman understands the sacred objective: plant the bomb or defuse it, hold the site or take it, clutch or be clutched upon. And in this shared understanding, we are united, even as we scream most colorful obscenities at one another across voice chat.

And oh, the thrill of victory! When a plan unfolds with perfect execution, when the final kill is secured in a most dazzling display of skill, it is as if a great campaign has been won, and the digital world bows before you in triumph. But even in defeat, there is laughter—whether at the misfortunes of professionals faltering on the grandest stages, or at the content creators who bravely dare to queue into the madness, entertaining us with their folly and triumph alike.

From the opening of cases, an act akin to gambling with one's very soul, to the grand spectacles of international tournaments, Counter-Strike 2 remains a monument to the enduring spirit of competition. And in this, I must tip my hat to the architects of our warfare—Valve, that most enigmatic and mysterious entity, who, for all their peculiar silences and eccentric ways, have ensured that Counter-Strike endures.

That we find ourselves in 2025, still wielding our rifles and executing our tactics, is nothing short of remarkable. A most glorious time to be alive, my friends.

Well done, Valve. Well done, GabeN.

730,"Counter-Strike 2 — это долгожданное продолжение культовой серии шутеров от первого лица, но, к сожалению, игра не обошлась без своих недостатков. Несмотря на множество нововведений и улучшений, есть несколько аспектов, которые существенно портят впечатление от игрового процесса.

Во-первых, проблема с читерами остается актуальной. С каждым игровым матчем игроки сталкиваются с нечестной игрой, когда противники используют запрещенные программы для получения преимущества. Это создает токсичную атмосферу, которая отталкивает новых игроков и делает игру менее привлекательной. Разработчикам необходимо срочно уделить внимание системе античита, чтобы устранить этот недуг.

Во-вторых, среди игроков можно встретить множество «прокачанных» пользователей, которые благодаря помощи других игроков поднимают свои рейтинги, не обладая достаточными навыками. Это приводит к тому, что матчмейкинг становится необъективным, и новички вынуждены соперничать с опытными игроками, которые попали в их команду по обстоятельствам, а не по своим умениям. Чувство несправедливости значительно портит удовольствие от игры.

Несмотря на свои визуальные и механические улучшения, Counter-Strike 2 сталкивается с серьезными проблемами, связанными с читерами и неуместными игроками. Если разработчики смогут справиться с этими недостатками, игра сможет заново завоевать доверие и любовь фанатов.

I have never seen a game that has such a high rate of exploiters and plain cheaters. 4 games in a row, cheaters.

Anarchy RUST servers have less cheaters than this sh*te. DO NOT PLAY.

Not only this, but Valve makes no effort at all to upgrade / update their anti-cheat. So not only do you get skull-r*ped by a cheater... they get away with it. Worst experience of my life. If you need proof, just go to the massively popular CS cheater community on reddit. You'll find all the proof there. Over 30k people in it. Cheating. Sharing cheats. Top 4% community.

730,"**Title: Still a Classic, But Seriously, Fix the Bugs**

*Counter-Strike 2* had a lot to live up to, and while it’s not *bad*, it’s frustrating to see that the devs haven’t ironed out some pretty glaring issues that *should* have been addressed before launch.

First off, the gameplay itself is solid. The core mechanics of *Counter-Strike* are still intact—team-based, tactical action that rewards precision and strategy—but the transition to the Source 2 engine seems rushed in some places. Sure, the graphics are stunning and the maps look better than ever, but it feels like the game is still a bit... unfinished.

Let’s talk about **server stability**. I’ve had multiple matches where the game randomly stutters or freezes for a second, only to have me die in the most frustrating ways. And don’t get me started on the **hit registration**—sometimes it feels like you’re firing directly at someone’s head, only for the bullets to somehow miss. In a game where split-second decisions matter, that’s a major problem. It’s like the game is actively punishing you for trying to play at a high level.

Also, the **balance issues** are all over the place. Some weapons feel either way too strong or way too weak. The new economy changes feel odd, and I’ve had plenty of matches where I was stuck in a bad situation simply because the new weapon system feels unbalanced. There’s a lot of work to do here before it feels like a fair game for all players, not just the ones who exploit the most broken weapons.

Let’s not forget the **anti-cheat**. It’s a big talking point, and while it’s definitely better than *CS:GO’s*, there are still cheaters getting through, and that’s beyond frustrating when you’re trying to enjoy a competitive match. The matchmaking also has its issues—sometimes you’ll end up in games with completely unbalanced teams, making the entire experience feel like a waste of time.

Finally, the **UI and menus** feel clunky. It's like they didn’t take enough time to make navigating the game smooth. Sometimes I’ll get stuck on loading screens or accidentally click the wrong button because it’s not intuitive. It’s minor, but it adds up to an overall frustrating experience.

**Pros:**
- Classic *Counter-Strike* gameplay that still works
- Stunning graphics, Source 2 engine really shines
- Good core mechanics

**Cons:**
- **Serious server issues** (lag, freezes, stutters)
- **Hit registration problems**—feels like bullets don’t register at times
- **Weapon and economy imbalance** ruins the flow of matches
- **Anti-cheat isn’t perfect**—cheaters still find their way through
- **UI and menus** are clunky and unintuitive
- **Unfinished feel**—it’s clear the game still needs a lot of polish

Ultimately, *CS2* could be great if the devs actually put in the work to address these issues. Right now, it’s hard to recommend to anyone who wants a smooth, balanced experience. If you’re a *Counter-Strike* fan, there’s still fun to be had, but be prepared for a lot of frustration along the way.

[h3]Actual gameplay is not bad[/h3]
And is pretty fun, at least for such casual player as I am. I've been playing CS actively since GO, but also played 1.6 and Source.

- As far as content goes, I want to see more old maps, specifically Business Center or however it was called from CSGO.
- It also wasn't fun to loose all the achievements after GO and don't have anything in return besides the single stub.
- Bots are stupid. Like much more stupid than was in Source. And there is no real way to configure them. I believe there was an option in CSGO, which doesn't works now.
- There is also no more way to pick a specific map in casual, only groups, which is a bit annoying.
- Other than that, the game can be addictive, which is worth to notice if you can have issue with that.

[h3]However, in the last years the game becomes more and more unplayable[/h3]
- It starts with [b]random VAC timeouts[/b] in the middle of an interesting match, which will immediately kick you out and not let to join a new one until something is done. I've had those almost daily recently. This specific issue requires reinstall of the game (whole 50Gb with my poor Internet connection) and reboot of my PC. There is no way to affect that other to have a better connection to lose less time when (not if) that happens.
- Then, there are [b]cheaters[/b]. Like quite a lot, but not very often. But yeah, VAC and the stupid timeout issue won't stop them.
- After some recent updates I also have [b]random complete freezes[/b] almost every match after a while. My PC isn't total crap, I play on minimal graphics, I have perfect connection at the time it happens and I also don't see not even a bit of spike in RAM or CPU usage. Also, this is the only game where it happens and it's constant enshitification over the last years made me almost sure that the game itself is the issue.",False

You replaced CS:GO entirely with 2 instead of creating a new version and keeping the previous one as well. It's good we still got CS 1.6 to play since CS2 is not working.
At the same time you removed CS:GO without even coming up with a macOS version for CS2. No mention of dropping macOS whatsoever.
You also lied about the game ""Coming this summer"", but it was released on 28 of September. Transparency needs to improve at Volvo.

Also: Gabe Follower is the biggest clown in the CS community.

In addition, the game is very well balanced, which means that all weapons have their advantages and disadvantages. This makes each match fairer and more balanced, allowing players of different levels to compete against each other.

Another positive point of CS:GO is its engaged and welcoming community. There are many people around the world who play the game and are always willing to help newcomers adapt to the gameplay and learn new skills.

First, it builds upon the solid foundation laid by its predecessors, refining mechanics while maintaining the core elements that players love. The tactical, team-based gameplay encourages strategy and communication, which makes every match unique. Whether you're defusing bombs, rescuing hostages, or simply taking down opponents, teamwork and coordination are vital to success.

The game's high skill ceiling keeps it engaging for both newcomers and veterans alike. The balance between weapon choices, map design, and player skill allows for a fair and exciting experience, where no two games feel exactly the same. The skill progression from beginner to pro is satisfying, offering constant room for improvement.

Additionally, Counter-Strike 2 is known for its thriving esports scene. Competitive play, regular updates, and community-driven content keep the game fresh, and its global popularity ensures a large, dedicated player base. The introduction of new graphical updates and better performance further enhances the experience, making it visually appealing while maintaining its competitive edge.

However, the current state of the game is absolutely terrible. First and foremost, the optimization is still awful. The game runs poorly even on high end systems, which is unacceptable at this point. On top of that, the matchmaking is completely unfair. If you're a new player trying PUBG for the first time, you'll be thrown into lobbies filled with veterans who have been playing for years. As a result, you stand no chance. The moment you land, you're eliminated almost instantly, making it nearly impossible to enjoy or learn the game. I'm not saying PUBG was ever a perfect game, but at least it used to be fun and offered an enjoyable experience. You could have great laughs with friends, and the game felt rewarding. What bothers me the most about modern PUBG is that the developers seem desperate to turn it into something similar to Fortnite. This is most evident in the excessive focus on cosmetic items skins, outfits, and weapon designs that feel completely out of place in a game that originally prided itself on a more realistic battle royale experience. Another frustrating change is the lack of map selection. In the past, players could choose which map they wanted to play on, but now the game forces you into a random one. This removes a level of control and strategy that was once part of the experience. Had I written this review several years ago, I would have wholeheartedly recommended PUBG.

Along with this while playing the game directly you constantly run into mayor performance issues where parts of the map don't load properly giving other players an advantage over you. Out of nowhere you will get massive lagspikes where the game updates 1 frame every 3-5 seconds and these last well over a minute which is more than enough time to call the match over for you in a pinch.

It can be frustrating, but if you try your best, you will get better and it is rewarding. Always coming back to it as very few games can give such a feeling.

Ofc there are some cosmetic microtransaction, they need money to run the servers and administration, updating and anticheating.

I like(or liked) the game, its fun, fairly realistic and when it comes to sounds and weapons not bad at all.
But, it is infested by cheaters, not just meeting one every now and then, they are in every match and are apparently allowed to cheat as they are almost never permanently banned.

The cheating seams to come and go, some times less, sometimes totally unplayable and it is always worst at the asian servers.
Add to that a lot of server down time, high ping and package loss.

But when there occasionally is less cheaters and the servers are  functioning properly, it is a great game.
I would pay (again)for the possibility to play the game with a functioning anti cheat system, fast servers and Vac bans implemented.

Ah, PUBG. The game that made Winner Winner Chicken Dinner a phrase worth fighting for. If you've spent 202.5 hours in this war-torn, loot-scavenging, tension-filled world, then you know the drill: Drop. Loot. Shoot. Pray the circle favours you. But does PUBG still hold up in 2025, or has it been outgunned by newer battle royals? Let’s break it down.  

---

The Good Stuff 

✅ Realistic, Intense Gunplay  
PUBG doesn’t hold your hand—every firefight is high-stakes and tactically demanding. Whether it’s a long-range sniper battle or a last-circle shotgun duel, gunplay feels authentic and satisfying** (when desync isn’t ruining your day).  

✅ Diverse Maps & Gameplay Variety 
From the wide-open fields of Erangel to the close-quarters chaos of Sanhok, PUBG offers a variety of ways to die horribly—I mean, strategies to win. The evolving map pool keeps things fresh, even after hundreds of hours.  

✅ Adrenaline-Packed Moments 
PUBG’s magic lies in the tension. The sweaty-palmed final circles, the unexpected ambushes, the sheer panic when a squad rolls up in a UAZ—it’s an emotional rollercoaster every match.  

✅ Now Free-to-Play 
Since going F2P, the game is more accessible than ever. New players can jump in, though whether they’ll survive long enough to enjoy it is another question.  

---

The Not-So-Great Stuff 

❌ Bugs, Glitches, & the Occasional Rage-Inducing Desync  
PUBG has improved massively since its early days, but let’s be real—it’s still got jank. Bullets sometimes refuse to hit targets, vehicles behave like haunted rollercoasters, and you will** die to the blue zone because your vault animation bugged.  

❌ Steep Learning Curve (Especially for New Players)
PUBG doesn’t throw flashy abilities or easy mechanics at you. It’s a brutal, skill-based game that rewards experience—but that also means new players get destroyed instantly. If you're not a veteran, expect to spectate a lot at first.  

❌ Cheaters & Hackers Still Exist
Even with anti-cheat improvements, hackers occasionally turn a promising match into a ""well, that was pointless"" experience. Nothing ruins PUBG faster than getting lasered by some wallhacking tryhard.  

❌ Pacing Issues (AKA 20-Minute Looting Simulations)
Sometimes, you spend **half a match looting, finding zero enemies—only to get third-partied the moment you engage in a fight. It’s the PUBG experience in a nutshell: hours of patience, moments of panic, and seconds of pure regret.

---

Final Verdict: Should You Play It?

If you love tactical, high-risk firefights, PUBG is still one of the most intense shooters out there. The gunplay is top-tier, the maps keep evolving, and every match tells a different story—sometimes tragic, sometimes hilarious. But it’s not for the faint of heart. The game can be brutal, frustrating, and buggy, but if you’ve stuck with it for over 200 hours, you already know the struggle.  

Score: 8/10 – Still one of the best, but prepare for pain.

578080,"Ah, PUBG. The game that's been around since the dinosaurs roamed the earth, and yet, somehow, it still feels like it's in beta. Like, a really, really long beta. You know that feeling when you order a pizza and it arrives looking exactly like the one you ordered last year? That's PUBG.

Look, I get it. The core gameplay is still kinda fun, like watching a squirrel try to bury a nut. But then, BAM! You get headshot from across the map by someone who's clearly using their gaming chair as a teleporter. It's like playing Russian roulette, but instead of bullets, it's cheaters. And let me tell you, the chamber is fully loaded.

Seriously, 8 out of 10 games? I'm starting to think the developers are secretly running a cheater training program. ""Welcome to PUBG Cheater Academy! Your first lesson: Aim for the head, through walls, while doing a backflip.""

And don't even get me started on the map selection in duos. It's like they threw a dart at a map of ""Random"" and called it a feature. I just want to play Erangel, not get lost in whatever weird, alien landscape they decided to throw us into this time.

Pros:

Sometimes, you get a chicken dinner. (Rare, like seeing a unicorn riding a bicycle.)
The panic when you're down to the last few players is... memorable?

Cons:

Cheaters. More cheaters than a convention for cheaters.
Map selection in duos is a cruel joke.
Feels like they're recycling content from the Stone Age.

578080,"f you enjoy frustration, glitches, and outdated mechanics, then PUBG: Battlegrounds is the perfect game for you. What was once a promising battle royale experience has turned into an absolute mess of unoptimized gameplay, unbalanced mechanics, and a developer team that seems to have no idea what they’re doing.

Let’s start with the controls—because they feel like they were designed by someone who has never played a shooter in their life. Movement is clunky, aiming is awkward, and don’t even get me started on the horrendous gunplay. Half the time, you’ll be fighting against the game’s own janky physics rather than actual opponents.

Oh, and the bugs? PUBG has more bugs than a decaying swamp. You’ll find yourself stuck in walls, rubberbanding across the map, or even dying to invisible enemies because the servers run like they’re being powered by a potato. Speaking of servers—why does a game this old still suffer from lag and desync issues? It’s ridiculous.

And let’s not forget the cheaters. PUBG is INFESTED with hackers, and the anti-cheat system is about as useful as a wet paper bag in a hurricane. Expect to be headshotted from across the map by someone using an aimbot while the developers do nothing about it.

Graphics? Outdated. Gameplay? Repetitive. Updates? Usually break more than they fix. Honestly, PUBG feels like it should have been left behind in 2018. There are way better battle royale games out there, and yet this one somehow still clings to life like a rotting corpse refusing to die.

Final Verdict: ★☆☆☆☆ – Play literally anything else.",False

The diverse maps in PUBG are a visual treat, each boasting unique and eye-catching color palettes that contribute to a serene and immersive gameplay experience.

578080,"The Classic Battle Royale That Still Delivers

PUBG: Battlegrounds set the standard for battle royale games, and it still stands as one of the best in the genre. The gameplay is intense, with a perfect mix of strategic planning and adrenaline-pumping action. Dropping onto an island with 99 other players, scavenging for weapons and gear, and then battling it out to be the last one standing is as thrilling as ever.

The maps are large, varied, and beautifully designed, offering plenty of opportunities for ambushes, sneaky plays, or all-out combat. The shooting mechanics feel solid, and the gunplay has a satisfying weight to it, with a wide range of weapons and attachments to choose from. Whether you’re going for a long-range sniper shot or close-quarters combat, the game offers plenty of flexibility in playstyles.

The game has seen improvements over the years in terms of performance and stability, but it can still experience occasional lag, bugs, or frustrating glitches. The matchmaking can sometimes feel a bit slow, especially for solo players, and the community can be hit or miss, with the occasional toxic player ruining the experience.

That being said, PUBG remains one of the best battle royale experiences out there, especially if you enjoy tactical gameplay and a slower pace compared to faster, more arcade-like battle royales. It’s worth jumping in for the thrill of intense battles, and with regular updates and events, there’s always something to look forward to.

✔️ Free-to-play model (since 2022)

Cons:
❌ Can feel slow-paced for some players
❌ Occasional bugs and optimization issues
❌ Tough learning curve for newcomers
Review:

PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS is the game that started the battle royale craze, and despite the rise of competitors like Fortnite, Warzone, and Apex Legends, it still delivers a unique and intense experience. The game’s realistic gunplay, bullet physics, and vast open-world maps set it apart from its more arcade-like rivals. Whether you're sneaking through Erangel’s forests, battling in Miramar’s deserts, or surviving in Vikendi’s snowy landscapes, each match feels like a tactical challenge.

The tension of looting, positioning, and engaging in firefights is what makes PUBG stand out. Every decision matters, and a single mistake can send you back to the lobby. The introduction of new weapons, vehicles, and game modes has helped keep things fresh over the years. However, it still struggles with occasional bugs and performance issues, especially on lower-end PCs.

For newcomers, the game can feel punishing due to the high skill ceiling, but for veterans, that’s what makes every victory feel earned. If you’re a fan of realistic battle royale games and don’t mind the slow-paced, strategic nature of PUBG, it remains a solid choice even in 2025.

Would I recommend it? Yes, but only if you enjoy methodical and tactical shooters over fast-paced arcade-style action

Gameplay: The mechanics feel clunky and outdated. The aiming system is unresponsive, and the movement feels sluggish. This makes the game frustrating rather than enjoyable. - translation - game is shit

Overall Rating: ★★★★☆

PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG), developed by KRAFTON, is one of the pioneers of the battle royale genre. Dropping into a massive open map with 99 other players, scavenging for weapons, and fighting to be the last one standing creates intense and unpredictable gameplay. While PUBG has seen competition from newer titles, it remains a thrilling and tactical shooter.

Gameplay & Gunplay: ★★★★★

PUBG is known for its realistic gunplay, which feels satisfying and skill-based. Weapons have distinct recoil patterns, bullet drop, and attachment customization, making combat both challenging and rewarding. The game also features multiple large maps with varied environments, requiring players to adapt their strategies.

Survival & Tension: ★★★★★

Unlike faster-paced battle royales, PUBG focuses on tactical survival. The pacing is slower, with a strong emphasis on positioning, sound awareness, and smart decision-making. The tension of being the last player alive in a final-circle showdown is unmatched.

Graphics & Performance: ★★★☆☆

While PUBG has improved visually over the years, it still struggles with optimization. Even high-end PCs can experience stutters, and console versions have performance issues. The game’s visuals are decent, but the occasional glitches and slow rendering can be frustrating.

Updates & Community: ★★★☆☆

KRAFTON regularly updates PUBG with new content, including weapons, maps, and modes. However, matchmaking can be inconsistent, and the player base has declined since its peak. The community is passionate but can be toxic, especially in ranked play.

Overall Verdict:

PUBG remains a tense and rewarding battle royale experience, with fantastic gunplay and deep tactical gameplay. While its performance issues and declining player base hold it back, it’s still an excellent choice for those who enjoy realistic, high-stakes survival shooters.",True

The marketplace? Dead. Instead of fixing the game, the devs are busy pumping out useless skins. Ranked mode? Only for squads. Why stop there? Let’s make it 10v10v64, just for fun.

This game once had 3 million players. Now it’s just filled with masochists keeping incompetent devs afloat. But hey, who cares? The game is broken, the balance is non-existent, but at least you can buy overpriced skins from a loot crate with a 1% drop rate.

I remember some Unreal Engine 4 games that had a best graphic along side with best optimization even for a console port on PC like Gears of War 5!
and now when I looking at PUBG, many things are off the chart... no good graphic at least you can say its not a mobile version...
With the worst possible optimization for AMD graphics cards, the frame rate you can get against Nvidia graphics cards is almost 1/3 lower, and its CPU consumption cannot be ignored at all. If you have an old processor, you should avoid running this game! If you have overclocked it, you should return it to the  factory defaults, otherwise 2 minutes after entering the game, you will get nothing but a crash(even inside the manu). DirectX 12 is also nothing more than a joke and the game still requires a high power single core processor to get a higher frame rate. And using this API, the game will beg you to install it on your expensive SSD! Because after 2-3 minutes, the textures will not load in high resolution, and this process will be repeated even in subsequent matches!

Overall Rating: ★★★★☆

PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG) revolutionized the battle royale genre, bringing large-scale survival gameplay to the mainstream. Despite competition from newer titles, PUBG still offers a tense and rewarding experience with its realistic gunplay, vast maps, and strategic depth. However, technical issues and optimization problems continue to hold it back.

Gameplay & Gunplay: ★★★★★
PUBG shines with its realistic gunplay, diverse arsenal, and tactical gameplay. Every bullet has weight, and mastering recoil control is essential. The game rewards strategic positioning, teamwork, and patience, making each match an intense experience.

Maps & Variety: ★★★★☆
With multiple maps like Erangel, Miramar, Sanhok, and Vikendi, PUBG offers different playstyles, from long-range desert battles to close-quarters jungle fights. The variety keeps the experience fresh, but some maps are less balanced than others.

Graphics & Performance: ★★★☆☆
While PUBG has improved its visuals over time, optimization remains an issue. Frame rate drops, desync, and occasional bugs can disrupt the experience, especially on lower-end systems. The mobile version, surprisingly, runs smoother than its PC counterpart.

Matchmaking & Cheaters: ★★★☆☆
Cheating has been a persistent problem in PUBG. While anti-cheat measures have improved, hackers still plague matches, making some games frustrating. Matchmaking can also be inconsistent, with bots appearing in lower-rank lobbies.

Overall Verdict:
PUBG remains a solid battle royale game with realistic combat, deep strategy, and high replayability. However, optimization issues and cheaters continue to be major drawbacks.

Weapons are all ground loot, no loadouts, no purchased blueprints with special attachments,no grind or pay to win bs, just ground loot that you upgrade during a match. Each gun feels like they have a punch to them,each with distinct sound,handling and recoil  pattern that you need to learn. Inventory matters. Learning curve for gear, guns,attachments, and maps are satisfying to master.  And vehicles man... they actually matter during a match, and handle intuitively for mouse & keyboard players. As for replay value, maps are huge and keep rotating,so i'm still figuring them out.

⭐ 9/10 – The King of Battle Royale Games! 👑🎮",True
578080,"One of the Best games out there, sadly a few cheaters to much",True
578080,"In my opinion the game has gotten far too competitive for my taste.
This is just my opinion but I feel like this game struggles with something similar to alot of once popular shooters that lose traction and develop a loyal playerbase. Lobbies fill up with bots and the real people are really good on average.
I started playing after the big hype back in 2017, so around 2021/2022 ish. I didn't realize the first few games were bot matches so I hopped in and got around 7-11 kills per game so I felt pretty confident and was enjoying the game, but when I entered real matches I got ABSOLUTELEY CLAPPED. 
Listen, I'm not an FPS pro by any means but I have been playing FPS games for many years, but none of it carried over when fighting these guys. Getting shot from 800m away, from bushes/trees, while driving at 95 kmph and being one pumped around corners was a big deterrent for me when I hopped into real games.
Even my buddy with around 1k hours was getting pulverized too, once we hopped into duos lobbies.

No hate for any PUBG players still out there, you guys are insane, but personally it's too competitive for me or my friends to hop on sadly (I'll probably stick to climbing CS if I'm feeling FPS)",False
578080,"Built a new PC and downloaded PUBG for some nostalgic fun, they've added confusing ass shop-battlepass-token crafting BS, I'll just ignore that because I'm here to game. 

Loaded into my first match it completely froze on me, even closing from task manager is doing nothing. I needed to fully restart my brand new PC just to get rid of it. 

What were those years of additional development do?",False
578080,"This game is one of the most well-known battle royale games on Steam. Even though it has been around for years, many players still enjoy it. The game offers intense gunfights, strategic gameplay, and a realistic survival experience.

There are many game modes that we can play, but the main one is battle royale. You drop onto a big map with 99 other players, loot weapons and gear, and try to be the last one standing. There are also ranked matches for more competitive players and arcade modes like Team Deathmatch for who want to play in a quick match.

The gunplay is one of the best things about this game. The weapons feel powerful, and the shooting mechanics are very realistic. If you like tactical shooters, you will enjoy the challenge. However, the game can sometimes feel slow, especially when you spend a long time looting and then die in one second.

The game community still has an active player base, but the community is mixed. There are many skilled players, but also a lot of hackers, especially in ranked games. The developers do ban cheaters, but it feels like there are always more coming.

Playing with friends is the best way to enjoy the game. Solo games can be frustrating, but if you have a squad, the game becomes a lot more fun. You can work together, make plans, and have funny moments.

One of the biggest problem in PUBG is toxic players, especially asian gamers. Many players spam the voice chat, scream, or just ruin the game for others. If you don’t mute them, they can be really annoying. Some also team up unfairly in solo mode, which makes the game frustrating.

Of course, not all players are bad, but the problem is common. Maybe developers could fix this by improving the reporting system or adding better region filters.

The graphics still look good, but the game is not well optimized. Even for the good PC. If you configure your graphics to be high but your opponents set it to be very low, they can see you better in some angles.

Lastly, I would say that this game still a fun battle royale game, but it has some issues. The gameplay is great, but the community, cheaters, and toxic players can ruin the experience. If you enjoy tactical shooters and can handle the problems, PUBG is still worth playing. But if you want a smoother experience, other battle royale games might be better.",True
578080,"germans storm the front and the french wait until dawn is long due! great game! its a mix of pokemon and gta, absolutely awesome!! highly recommend!! Extreem fun!!",True
578080,"constantly updated, still manages to be fun, tho the learning curve is absolutely animalic",True
578080,"What I Love:

✅ Tactical Gameplay – Unlike more arcade-style BR games, PUBG forces you to play smart. Positioning, sound cues, and map knowledge matter more than just raw aim. Every decision—whether to engage or hide—can determine your fate.

✅ Diverse Maps – From the classic Erangel to the fast-paced Sanhok and the open Miramar, each map offers unique strategies. Vikendi's snowy landscapes and Taego's Korean setting also add variety.

✅ Gunplay is Satisfying – The weapons feel great, and mastering recoil control is a skill in itself. No two fights feel the same, and every gunfight is a high-stakes encounter.

✅ Squad Play is a Blast – Playing with friends elevates the game. Communication, strategy, and clutch moments make every session memorable.
What Could Be Better:

❌ Optimization Issues – PUBG has improved over the years, but it can still feel clunky, especially on lower-end PCs. Occasional desync and lag can ruin critical moments.

❌ Steep Learning Curve – New players might struggle with the realistic mechanics, slow pacing, and punishing gunfights. It's not as pick-up-and-play as other BRs like Warzone or Apex.

❌ Bots in Some Matches – In lower ranks, bot-filled lobbies can make early games feel less exciting.
Final Thoughts:

PUBG may not be as flashy as newer battle royale games, but it remains one of the best for those who love tactical, high-risk gameplay. Whether you're playing solo, duo, or squad, every match tells a unique story.

Rating: 8.5/10 – A classic BR that still delivers intense, rewarding gameplay, but it’s not the most beginner-friendly or optimized experience.",True

The game just wasn't fun anymore when you're dying in some BS latency issues.

Obviously everyone finds there own way to play to suit them - I originally started playing in teams but i now find it much easier to do solo matches due to other players not following rules during a multi-team match and having my fellow team mates killing me - reviving me - then killing me again.

[*] [b]Complicated Gun Physics[/b] — Just to learn how to shoot properly, expect to spend at least [b]200 hours in training[/b]. Not exaggerating.
[*] [b]Cheaters Everywhere[/b] — You’ll encounter [i]multiple cheaters in nearly every match[/i]. It’s a fact.
[*] [b]Pointless Ranking System[/b] — It doesn’t affect matchmaking at all. Newbies end up playing against [b]5,000+ hour veterans[/b] with top-tier ranks. [i]Fun, right?[/i]
[*] [b]Random Matchmaking[/b] — No skill-based balancing whatsoever. Winning often depends on pure [b]luck[/b]: the zone, positioning, and weapons you find.
[/list]

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Want to Get Good? Good Luck...[/h2]

Just to be a [i]decent[/i] player (not even great), you’ll need to:

[list]
[*] Learn the ins and outs of [b]drops[/b] and pick the best landing spots.
[*] Master [b]looting[/b] quickly and efficiently.
[*] Understand every [b]weapon[/b] and nail down recoil control.
[*] Develop a feel for [b]distance[/b] and take [b]key positions[/b].
[*] Be ready to [i]adapt instantly[/i] to any situation.
[/list]

And that’s just the beginning. Yes, like every game requires effort — [i]BUT HERE, EVERYTHING IS DESIGNED TO FRUSTRATE YOU X100[/i].

[hr][/hr]

[h2]The Competitive Scene? Completely Dead[/h2]

Let’s not even talk about [b]pro play[/b], [b]competitive modes[/b], or [b]tournaments[/b]—because they’re [i]completely dead[/i]. There are maybe [b]one or two casual fan tournaments every couple of months[/b]. That's it.

If you’re hoping to dive into an exciting esports scene — [i]forget it[/i]. PUBG is nothing but a [b]ghost town[/b] when it comes to real competition.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Why Is PUBG Still Alive? A Mystery[/h2]

Honestly, [b]this game should’ve died a long time ago[/b]. The [i]only reason[/i] I keep playing is to team up with friends — because that’s the [b]only thing[/b] that makes this mess even remotely enjoyable.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Don’t Believe in Dreams of Skill[/h2]

If you watched [b]Recreant[/b] and think, [i]“I can do that too!”[/i] — [b]SPOILER ALERT![/b]

[b]YOU. NEVER. WILL.[/b]  
It’s just not going to happen. Ever. Forget about it and move on.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Final Verdict[/h2]

[b]PUBG[/b] survives purely on the [i]momentum of old players[/i] and the [i]occasional fun of playing with friends[/i].

Unfinished, unbalanced, flooded with cheaters, and featuring one of the worst monetization systems out there. Why anyone still plays this when there are far better battle royales available is a mystery I’ll never understand.

Should you play?
Why not it's still better than MW

Random stuff:-
Got hooked on PUBG again just because of the intense battle royale mode.
The game is not what we used to know but compared to it's Counter part ""PUBG Mobile"" it can still be called PUBG.
***The game has changed alot of course Switch to unreal engine 5 being the biggest thing***
Pros of UE5:
Ofc game looks 10x better and there is environmental destruction everywhere so you can dig a hole and hide inside so that last guy during a 1v1 gets flashbacks.
-Yep only that is good no other pros-
***Cons***
Cuz of UE5:
>Say goodbye to FPS.
Recoil of each gun has been increased by 50% so when you kill someone you are already looking to the lord for forgiveness.
>Alot of Random bs will happen like Ppl appearing through walls,ppl will super powers walking on water.

578080,"The Good
✅ Realistic Gunplay – Weapons feel authentic, with distinct recoil and bullet drop mechanics.

✅ Adrenaline-Packed Moments – Clutch plays, intense firefights, and last-circle showdowns make for thrilling experiences.

The Bad
❌ Performance Issues – Even years after launch, PUBG still suffers from occasional lag, desync, and poor optimization, especially on lower-end PCs.
❌ Cheaters & Hackers – Like many online shooters, cheating remains a problem, particularly in ranked matches.
❌ Steep Learning Curve – The game has complex mechanics, and new players often struggle against experienced opponents.
❌ Inconsistent Updates – Some updates bring great content, while others introduce bugs or unwanted changes.

578080,"Ladies and gentlemen, fellow gamers, and dedicated PUBG players,


Today, we gather not just as mere gamers, but as champions of the virtual realm, united by our shared love for PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. We stand here, ready to embark on a new adventure, to conquer new frontiers, and to embrace the challenges of this immersive battleground. This isn't just a game; it's an experience, a test of skill, strategy, and teamwork.


PUBG has brought us together from all corners of the world. We have formed friendships, built alliances, and shared countless unforgettable moments on this digital battlefield. But today, I want to remind you of the true essence of PUBG, what makes it more than just a game. It's about teamwork, strategy, and most importantly, the thrill of the fight.


In PUBG, we are not just players; we are survivors. We are the brave souls who jump out of that plane, landing in an unknown land with nothing but our wits and a burning desire to be the last person or team standing. It's not just about shooting and looting; it's about making decisions under pressure, adapting to ever-changing circumstances, and achieving victory against all odds.


As PUBG players, we have faced countless challenges and adversities. We've faced fierce opponents, formidable obstacles, and heart-pounding encounters. But we keep coming back because we are determined, we are resilient, and we thrive on competition. We learn from our failures and celebrate our successes.


But remember, it's not just about individual glory; it's about teamwork. In squads and duos, we learn to trust each other, to communicate effectively, and to have each other's backs. In the world of PUBG, a well-coordinated team can overcome even the most daunting adversaries. So, let's continue to build our squads, nurture our friendships, and become even more formidable together.


As PUBG players, we understand that the journey is just as important as the destination. It's about the moments when your squad survives a hail of gunfire, the exhilaration of a well-earned chicken dinner, and the laughter and camaraderie we share in the process.


But remember, it's not just about the victories; it's about the sportsmanship. Let's remember to be good winners and gracious losers. Let's support each other, help newcomers, and build a positive and inclusive community.


So, fellow players, as we rally here today, let's remember why we fell in love with PUBG in the first place. It's about the thrill of the battle, the friendships we've forged, and the indomitable spirit that keeps us coming back for more. Let's keep pushing the boundaries of our skills, adapting to the ever-evolving battlegrounds, and continue to write our own epic stories on the virtual battlefield.


I challenge you all to be the best PUBG players you can be, to inspire others, and to have fun doing it. Together, we can make PUBG a game that not only challenges us but brings us together and empowers us to become better players and better people.


Are you ready, PUBG players? Let's jump into the plane, drop into the battleground, and face the challenges ahead with courage, determination, and a passion for the game that unites us all. It's time to claim victory and show the world what PUBG players are made of!


Thank you, and may your battles be epic and your chicken dinners plentiful!",True

They post weekly updates about how many people they have banned and its staggering. All in all this is a fantastic game and very fun.

I have absolutely no idea what this game is trying to be. Is it a gritty tactical shooter or a goofy ah action shooter? I don't know, and I don't think PUBG knows either. Game has some of the worst gunplay I've ever experienced in a shooter. If their goal was to make every action feel like you're covered in molasses, they nailed it. Movement feels like an early PS2 game, paired with shooting that they couldn't have made clunkier if they tried.

also harvey on top",True

413150,"I LOVE Stardew Valley! The characters, storylines, art, music.. it really shows that the game was made with love and care. Though it does get a bit boring in late game, but that's why mods and challenges exist. One of my favorite games ever",True
413150,wow just wow its super amazing and very replayable,True
413150,"Stardew Valley is a masterpiece of cozy, immersive gameplay, which offered me a charming escape into the countryside. The heart of the game lies in its deep, well written characters. Each villager has a unique personality, backstory, and daily routine, making Pelican Town feel truly alive. Through conversations, heart events, and festivals, you gradually form meaningful bonds with the townspeople.",True
413150,"I highly recommend this game! It gives me major Harvest Moon vibes, a game I haven't played since I was a kid. I just wish I could afford a property like the ones in the game—guess that's why they make games like this, to let us live out our fantasies, lmao

(Hmm I wonder how many hours I can physically get in game before steam stops keeping track lol)",True
413150,This game is amazing but it makes you want to all of a sudden make your room a nature design and be productive which scares me but also you can annoy people in this game so of course its a amazing game,True
413150,"Hiiii <3 
Stardew Valley was one of the best farming games I've ever played!!!
I have played this game for years and I still love it, I would highly recommend this game if you'd like to chill out/ relax, explore+discover, learn (I learned through this game a lot about farming, fishes, seasons), fight enemies, design, build a family and just have fun in this game! <3
And each character has their own story and not all of them are happy and peaceful some of them have a dark back story.
*And the game is only growing with the years (new updates)- Has new places to explore, new things to learn and meet new friends. 




",True
413150,"One of my most played games. I own it on several platforms so that I can play it with basically anyone, or play it basically anywhere. I keep coming back, even if there are months where I don't play it, because every time I start up a new farm with a new farmer, it gets its hooks in me and I can't even sleep without thinking about this game. I will probably play this game for a great many more years to come. Multiplayer is probably also the best thing to happen to Stardew. Cannot recommend this game enough (yes, even the fishing).",True
413150,It's a really nice game that's got a lot of different elements and never gets boring despite being just incredibly benevolent and wholesome,True
413150,amazing love this game so much i wish it had more story since ive completed it many times and should add more marriage options and more heart events with all characters.,True
413150,"I never seem to be able to finish this game. I always find myself restarting my file.
All the events and characters are so diverse and cute, it's satisfying to get to know them as we play.
One thing I hate about this game is THE DAMN SKULL CAVERN (Bless you who made the skull cavern elevator mod)

Bonus point for all the modders out there, thank you for making my emo man Sebastian looks not so emo <3
I might spend the rest of my life playing stardew and restarting over and over again to marry all characters...
So excited :>",True
413150,"Always a different farm, a different layout, a different play style.. and always a great time! Every time I play, I feel like I'm learning and getting better. This is an excellent title to play alone or with friends.",True
413150,"This game is super fun, never truly feels repetitive. Probably the game I have most hours on aside from Minecraft or something on my Wii, like -- Mario Party 7, or something. 

Characters are fun, the art is honestly really pretty. I love Krobus, and my dogs. Shallow enough for wiggle room, I wish there was more dialogue honestly. But it is still hype.

I will say, the wiki is your friend, it is super hard to really get what you need without actually knowing what to do. Don't be afraid to craft, I am, for some reason. Also, don't listen to 100% people who try to force you to maxmize in every way. Have fun unless you want to 100%.

Multiplayer sucks unless you have more than two players. That is also a thing.",True
413150,I always loved playing Stardew Valley it never been boring I play it on every platform I really love this game and hope much more people get to knows it so they can enjoy it like I do,True
413150,"Game to escape the woes of modern capitalist society and join an actual community plus farm. 

However after first year you try to min max profit and try to be as efficient as possible. The townfolk never see you as you're too busy tending to live stock and making starfruit wine. You are stuck in an endless loop of trying to increase your wealth and realize you're just another cog in the capitalist machine. 

10/10 Would recommend. Worth the money.",True
413150,"One of the BEST cozy games out there! No stress, can't really ever go wrong. Just a chill game where you have your own farm and complete tasks around the town. My favourite go-to comfy game to relax after a long day! Definitely reccommend! <3",True

413150,I love this game so much already. I've seen this game since it was launched but never thought of playing but my husband talk me into it. I thought it would be boring but oh god i was so wrong!. This is absolute gem!!!! 10/10,True

",True
413150,"A pure diamond. It sets the standards for all games of it's kind. One of the best games I've ever played, and I highly recommend it to anyone that I would meet. (Including my grandmother.) You can do so much in Stardew, from creating your dream farm to cheesing the economy and creating an impending environmental crisis that you would never see because this game is perfect, and you don't need to be to play it. This is a gem that will inspire generations to come. 11/10",True
413150,"Game so good, it made me cry so many times. Just proves that AAA graphics is not the sole basis of a good game. Who knew pixels could make me feel so much. I don't even wanna sell my chickens because I'm already attached to them.",True
413150,"Amazing! The love and attention that ConcernedApe has poured into this game truly shows. And he's not even done! Still adding content, years later, not asking for additional funds, this is a man's lifes work. He deserves every single penny of every single copy of this game that has sold.

Fishing can be a bit nasty early on, but once you get the hang of it, it tightens up. Combat, mining, farming, relationships, multiplayer, this game has a LOT going for it. Let the innumerable positive reviews do the talking!",True
413150,"Stardew valley is one of the most lovely games I have ever played. First time I played it, was 2 years ago, but I left it very early on, because I wasn't patient and I thought it's just a simple farming game. Thankfully, I downloaded it again approximately two months ago, and I play all the time. The complexity of the characters in game, how they are all unique, the things u can do in farming, fishing, mining etc. are all so great and exciting and you can tell how much thought has been put in this game. This game always cheers me up, and its great for when I want to spend some time chilling on my pc, and also great when I want to play with friends. It also has some mysteries that you can uncover, and there is always something to do. The thing I love most, is that you can play at your own pace, without feeling the need to hurry, and you can do whatever you want to do. I cannot recommend it enough! <3",True
413150,"At this point, I've played all of my value a million times over and will continue to play a million times more. It's an amazing game from beginning to end. The modding community is strong and you can make the game into anything you want beyond the base game. Concerned Ape, the developer, is wonderful and keeps bringing the heat.

theres a mod for that btw",False
413150,"Hello

I can say that Stardew Valley was one of the best farming games I've ever played

This game is more than a farming game, it's real life

Planting crops in different seasons is very interesting, as well as the rotation of seasons and...

Having animals is really beautiful and adds beauty to the game

The most interesting thing is that you can get married and have children (that's why I say it's more than a normal game)

Each character has their own story and some of them are really dark

You should definitely buy this game and play it",True
413150,My fave game of all times. It is very relaxing. I love that it is continously getting updated for free. So much fun and love for this game. This game heals soul.,True

413150,"I've been playing for a couple years, it's my favorite game ever. it never gets old. I love how unique it is, a farming game where you can date the towns people? yes please. The story is rich and there's so much content, i will never stop playing stardew valley",True
413150,"I've been playing this game for around 8 years. It is hands down one of my favorite games, the art and style of it in general is so comforting and pleasant. Watching the changes made over the years has been amazing, and ConcernedApe does an amazing job with every update! I can't believe I haven't written a review yet lol",True
413150,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet.
One of the best games I've every played with one of the best developers ever. It isn't possible for me to recommend this enough, and I somehow feel guilty for how little I spent on it.",True
413150,"Genuinely such a good game. So many hours in this game, and I still haven't gotten close to doing everything. Great game. Developer deserves infinite BJ's.",True
413150,Absolutely worth it. I replay it every couple years and there is a whole new game. The continued support and updates are fantastic.,True
413150,It is a very begginer friendly game and is a very relaxed and lay back game to play and can get exciting there is a great story line and have quests that you can complete for gold,True
413150,"Gameplay is absolutely phenomenal,    with a bonus of amazing functions that makes it 
difficult to run out of things to do most of the time,    It's a very nice relaxing game to play either for 
hours or briefly whether with friends or by yourself.         On top of that the designing ability,  graphics and 
storyline with details that comes with it.      This is one of the best games I've ever played and 
will always be one of my favorites

",True
413150,"this was my lockdown game. i have so many more hours on xbox but i switched over to pc too and the game is just as enjoyable as well as the option of modding. there's something so much more magical that makes this almost a fantasy game but not quite comprehensible and also haunting the narrative like you would typically find in tight-knit small towns.
the story behind it's creation is lovely and rooted in fan-creation and ConcernedApe supports the fans on their endeavours to make their own content for this harvest moon spin-off aswell. there's everything for me to love, but i completely understand people who dislike this game. i definitely have a personal connection and so a huge bias",True
413150,"There's so much to do, you can never get bored. It's one of the best games I've played in a while. It's pretty crazy that it's made by one person.",True
413150,"I didn't give it a review for too long I guess. 

The game is wonderful and is the best kind of balance between tension and relaxation. You should just take your own tempo and play. 

You have a couple of chores (that could be automatized) and then you have the rest of the day at your hands. There's a lot of ways to spend it too, so I'd recommend. 

You can't get wrong with Stardew Valley.",True
413150,"I enjoyed the story of the game, on how you decide what to do, I also enjoy all the  different activities there are to do",True
413150,"Stardew Valley is currently my #1 game. I've played 4 characters of my own, as well as co-op farms with others. Over 1k hours and will continue rising. You can play the game following the story-lines or just focus on what you prefer to focus on. One of my accounts is just trying to make my farm as well organized and beautifully created as I can. Another is focused on nothing but farming. There will be some hits by missing certain aspects of the story and npc events but none that I've experienced that have ruined the game entirely. Have yet to go with Jo-Jo Mart. Screw corporations. Even pixelated ones. Concerned Ape has done amazing with this game and I cannot wait til his next one is available.",True
413150,"Super cute game. I deffinetly reccomend it to peoplewho enjoy chill, farming type games. The storyline in adorable and the graphics too!",True
413150,"Can feel a little slow and grindy at times mainly due to trying to get the most out of each day so you do every little thing, which means making an efficient, repeatable path. But, it's all good vibes, the challenges scale mostly well, and the payoffs generally fit to the challenge. Modding can really help improve a replay, but you generally aren't going to know what to mod until after the first few frustrations. Overall, it gives the warm comforting feeling of an organic, free-range, artisanal, hand-crafted video game of someone who cares about the medium.",True
413150,"Stardew Valley is a charming farming sim that offers a relaxing yet deep gameplay experience. With engaging activities like farming, fishing, mining, and building relationships with the townspeople, it provides endless hours of enjoyment. The pixel-art style and soothing soundtrack create a cozy atmosphere. Whether playing solo or with friends, it’s an fun rewarding experience.

Rating: 10/10 – A must-play for fans of life sims and cozy games.",True
413150,"Very fun game! I have played for 63 hours so far plus more on my nintendo switch and I have to say, this game never gets boring. There is always something to do. I think mods also add more to the game which adds more content other than the other very fun content! Highly reccommend.",True
413150,"Stardew valley is my favorite game and has been for years! It is so fun, cute, and satisfying to play. I would recommend this game to anyone. You can play it however you want. From just focusing on farming, to decorating, to having relationships with the townsfolk, and so much more! This is the game I always come back to. There is so many different options to what you can do in a day. It can be challenging but also easy at the same time. I have this game on every device I possibly can. I like being able to play it wherever I go. This game has gotten me through so many life events. I've played it with friends on my PC, split screen with my husband on my switch for some date nights, on my living room tv while resting during my pregnancy, and even on my phone at night while on vacation where I couldn't bring a lot of devices. Stardew Valley is 100% the best game in my opinion!",True
413150,"Easily one of the best games of all time. It's so simple, but there is such a rich story, and a lot of heart. Add in the mod community, and CA's dedication to the community and content updates, years later, and it's a 10/10 for me.",True
413150,"This game is very fun, I love the cute storyline, cozy game mechanics and the fact that you can romance npcs.",True
413150,"I FREEEEEEEEAKING love this game. One of my friends finally picked it up and I have had the delight of starting to introduce her to the gameplay and even after 700 hours of play time and years of loving this game, I still love to come back to it. The art is phenomenal. The mechanics are intuitive. You will never regret playing this game.",True
413150,"I truly believe Stardew Valley is one of the greatest video games ever created. (fairly obvious given its many imitators)

After logging several hundred hours a few years ago, I've returned to find what feels almost like an entirely new game. The content has expanded exponentially, giving it even more longevity & playability. It is a beautiful homage to Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing, and life in the PNW. If you are from Washington or Oregon such as myself. Stardew is incredibly nostalgic & comfy. 

Stardew also punches well above its weight in terms of character writing & a meaningful progressive message that does not feel awkward, self-referential, or forced. Stardew features a diverse cast of characters, & unlike other more explicitly ""wholesome"" games (Animal Crossing, Story of Seasons) its characters actually feel like real people. They experience grief, addiction, depression, & trauma, however, they [i]also[i/] experience realistic character growth. It is truly a deep joy seeing characters develop past adversity in this way. 

The mechanics of Stardew are also brilliant. It's very intuitive--some of its crafting recipes may be a little odd, but for the most part it's easy to learn the game's logic. Stardew is completely playable without tutorials or wiki searches, however, should you choose to use outside help there is a wealth of information regarding any questions you may have. You can go full grind mode & try to progress the story as much as possible, or take it easy & wander through life.

This game has brought me & my friends endless hours of entertainment, comfort, & relaxation. I highly recommend Stardew to anyone & everyone.",True
413150,"this is genuinely one of the best games i have ever played. there are many ways to approach stardew and if you want some sort of goal so you can continue playing the game, try to achieve perfection! i did it after about 140 hours of playing it so it's definitely doable.",True
413150,"What is there to say?
Magnificent game in practically every way.
Pure and simple joy that can easily take away hours upon hours while simultaneously destress you after a long day.
The 2D art style is one of my favorites, and if you want a farm/small town life simulator, then this is one of the best, if not the best, options available.",True
413150,"Very big fan of this game! I used to play on my family Nintendo switch and this game was on my priority list to buy on steam as soon as I got a steam deck. It's an amazing game to either have a quick play session to pass the time or spend hours managing and upgrading your farm. The NPC's are really interactive and the game accommodates for a wide range of playstyle. You can work on your farm, fight monsters in the caves, create bonds with NPCs, fish for increasing difficult creatures, attend events, contribute to the community or sell it out to a large corrupt company.
All I really need to say is that I love this game and would 100% recommend it to anyone else who enjoys this genre of game.",True
413150,"If you've ever dreamed of living life on a farm, then Stardew Valley is definitely the game for you. But before you dive into all the fields and veggie-growing, let me tell you about the true highlight of this game: the chickens. Yes, you heard that right – chickens!

In Stardew Valley, you can pet chickens. And this is no small feature that you might overlook. Oh no. You can actually shower these fluffy little creatures with love as if they were your very own personal pets. And the best part? They come in all sorts of colors! There are brown chickens, white chickens, black chickens, blue chickens, and even golden chickens! (And dinosaurs. Basically chickens!) It just feels amazing to pet a chicken while it struts around with its little, proudly puffed-up comb.

And if you think that's all there is to the chickens, you haven't discovered the eggs yet. You can collect these little goodies, sell them, or just feed them to your pals. Chickens are basically the unsung heroes of the game. And honestly, who needs the rest of the game when you have such a great chicken to brighten your day?

Okay, okay – the rest of the game is pretty nice too. You can build your own piece of land, catch fish, plant trees, and deepen your relationships with the villagers. But let's be real, it's the chickens that really make the difference.


PS: To my boyfriend, if you're reading this, please start playing Stardew Valley with me IMMADIATELY. I'll even feed the chickens. <3",True
413150,"CUte and cozy, but has tryhard elements if you want to. It's so wholesome, you get to meet all the villagers and find out what each of them likes, explore the nature and all the different elements of the game by collecting things for the museum and on the side build a farm empire.",True
413150,"Stardew Valley is a timeless indie gem that combines farming, exploration, and storytelling into a deeply rewarding experience. With its flexible gameplay, you can farm, fish, mine, or build relationships with Pelican Town’s charming residents at your own pace. The pixel art is vibrant, the soundtrack is enchanting, and the seasonal changes keep the world fresh. Whether restoring the Community Center, uncovering secrets, or playing co-op with friends, the game offers endless replayability. Stardew Valley is a cozy, heartfelt escape that appeals to all players, making it a must-play masterpiece. 10/10
one of the best games i've played.",True
413150,"One of the best sim games ever made. Still gets updates nearly a decade later. One common thing that upsets people is the time limit of each day in game, but that will pretty much never (i think there's like 1 cutscene you can miss) make you actually miss anything permanently. You actually can do everything at your own pace. LOVE.IT. Labour of love by the developer and it shows.",True
413150,"Stardew Valley is one of the best games I have ever played! I was gifted it by a friend last fall, and I have sown so much time into it. There are so many ways to engage with this game's content. There is farming, fishing, crafting, foraging, mining, combat, arcade gaming, decorating, and more. Each of these different tasks can feed into each other in a way that is fun and creates for a unique play-through experience. One of my favorite parts of the game is socializing with my neighbors in the Valley and learning more about this story. You'll learn that the residents of this cute and cozy village have complex and sometimes dark backgrounds that make their presence known in cut-scenes and dialogues. After finishing my first 100% play-through, I enjoyed spending time watching lore videos that synthesized all of the different story elements gathered in the game (I won't spoil any of it, but I'll just say that the lore runs deep!). This game is exhilarating and relaxing, and it constitutes a gaming experience that makes you feel refreshed and appreciative of the little things in life. I have done all the achievements in the game, but I am still getting ready to log on to an old file now to play around with decorating my farm.",True
413150,I love the multiple storylines and the multiplayer option!! 10/10,True
413150,"Really decent game! It's got a real Animal Crossing meets Minecraft feel with tons of SNES game aspects. I can see influence from Chrono Trigger, Link to the Past, Final Fantasy and so many more nostalgic 90's games that I loved. Also, really fun co-op aspect going on here.",True
413150,"Stardew Valley: A Timeless Farming Adventure

Stardew Valley is a masterfully crafted farming simulation that blends charming pixel art, engaging gameplay, and heartfelt storytelling. Developed by a single person, Eric ""ConcernedApe"" Barone, the game stands as a testament to passion and dedication, offering a deeply rewarding experience that has captivated players worldwide.

At its core, Stardew Valley is a game about escaping the hustle of modern life to build a new home in a quiet rural town. Players inherit a run-down farm and are given the freedom to cultivate crops, raise animals, mine for resources, fish, forage, and even befriend (or romance) the locals. The game provides an incredible sense of progression, as every action contributes to the development of your farm and relationships with the community.

What makes Stardew Valley truly special is its depth. Beyond farming, the game offers intricate crafting, combat in the mines, an ever-changing calendar of festivals, and a compelling storyline tied to the mysterious Joja Corporation and the town’s struggle to thrive. Every season brings new crops, events, and challenges, keeping the gameplay fresh and exciting even after countless hours.

One of the most impressive aspects of Stardew Valley is its balance between relaxation and engagement. The days pass quickly enough to encourage strategic planning, yet the game never feels punishing. The soundtrack, composed by Barone himself, perfectly complements the cozy atmosphere, making every moment feel warm and nostalgic.

Multiplayer adds another layer of enjoyment, allowing friends to collaborate and share the farming experience. The game’s active modding community further expands its possibilities, offering new mechanics, visuals, and features for those looking to customize their journey.

After achieving 100% completion, I can confidently say that Stardew Valley is one of the most rewarding and fulfilling gaming experiences available. It is a beautifully crafted world that invites players to create their own stories, filled with joy, challenge, and personal achievements. Whether you're a casual player looking for a relaxing escape or a completionist aiming for perfection, Stardew Valley delivers in every way.

Final Verdict: 10/10 - A must-play for fans of simulation and cozy gaming.",True
413150,"With over 308 hours played and 27 out of 49 achievements unlocked, I can confidently say that Stardew Valley is one of the most immersive and rewarding games I've ever experienced.

Whether you're farming, fishing, mining, or befriending the townsfolk, the smooth and engaging gameplay keeps you invested without ever feeling overwhelming.

This game has a way of making time disappear—one more day in the valley turns into five, then ten, then suddenly it’s 2 AM in real life. Whether you're a casual player looking to unwind or someone who loves diving into challenges, there's something here for everyone.

The game does not have amazing graphics, but it does have many story lines and quests for you to do. You can grow your own crops and rear some livestock, sell them and complete the quest to progress in the game. There are plenty of community events for you to join throughout the calendar year and you may also get your in-game partner if you 'hardworking' enough.. Every morning in the game implies another busy day for us, harvesting crops.. feeding the animals... doing the quest... fishing... I don't even think I am that hardworking and disciplined in real life xD",True

Music - OH MY, so good. There are so many different things you can do and it takes a really long time for the game to feel repetitive.

Farm on your farm. Farm on an island. Dig to the bottom of the mine. Dig to the bottom of the super mine. I think there is a message in there about the evils of globalism too. This is the only farm game now. All other farm games are a scam and should be outlawed.

This game can be a grind, but there is always some kind of perk or reward you are working toward that makes it worth it. ALSO, the developer doesn't charge extra for updates.

An incredibly relaxing, and play-at-your-own-pace kind of game.

The kind of game I can pick up after a long day (or during a rainy weekend) and play at my leisure.
Try different farming, ranching or foraging methods with no penalties. 
Or just bum around  town and do random tasks.

In the beginning, you’ll find yourself clearing weeds, chopping wood, and watering crops by hand, but before long, you can transform your small plot into a flourishing homestead, complete with automated sprinklers, artisan goods production, and even a bustling community of friends and farm animals. However, nature has its own rhythm, and the changing seasons bring new challenges and opportunities, encouraging you to adapt and grow.

Join forces with other players in cooperative Multiplayer, where you can build up your farm together, share responsibilities, and explore the world side by side. Add mods to enhance your experience, from small quality-of-life improvements to full-fledged expansions that add new crops, festivals, and mechanics. While the core gameplay is an open-ended farming adventure, there are a variety of interesting activities, including mysterious caves to explore, friendships to forge, and even a corporation to resist. If you want to tailor your experience even further, you can use the in-game tools to modify the world, adjusting farm layouts, customizing your farm's look, or even creating new challenges for yourself and others.",True

There’s something incredibly soothing about spending time on my little farm, whether I’m planting crops, tending to animals, or fishing in the peaceful rivers of Pelican Town. The game’s pace is slow and relaxing, which makes it the perfect escape when I’m tired or need to take a breather from fast-paced, action-packed games.

The beauty of Stardew Valley is how it allows me to play at my own pace. There's no pressure, no rush, just me and my farm. The music is calming, the artwork is simple yet charming, and the characters are warm and engaging, which makes it feel like a cozy escape every time I play.

It's also the kind of game where I can just get lost for hours, getting into a rhythm of watering plants, making progress with friendships, and exploring the caves at my own leisure. Whether I'm tending to my crops or decorating my house, I always feel like I'm accomplishing something, even if it's just small, peaceful tasks.

If you're looking for a game to help you relax and reset after a long day or a series of more intense gaming sessions, Stardew Valley is a perfect choice. It’s my ultimate chill game, and I always return to it when I need that sense of calm. It’s a game that truly offers a little bit of everything, and for me, it never gets old.

It's nice that I can turn off the flashing lightning effects, the text is in a font that is easy to read, and the controls are simple so I can use it with a controller or play on my computer when I don't feel well.

413150,"I was once told by a professor of mine that we don't judge great art, great art judges us. Stardew Valley is one of the best games ever made, period. Nothing anyone says adds or detracts from that, which means that a person's appraisal of Stardew Valley says WAAAAY more about that person than it does about the game. You can tell a lot about an individual by how they appraise this game, but for the game itself: it's a masterpiece against which multiple genres, developers, and narratives are measured.",True

Maybe you want to till your crop in the morning, chill fishing while it's raining, or you can choose to be careless and stomped by a giant slime!

413150,"A beautiful game to play while listening to podcasts, talking with friends, playing with a significant other. Somewhat boring quests, progression is kind of hard if you don't immediately understand the game's mechanics. But it teaches you to keep track of a lot of things and that is both immersing and in a way scary because you will feel anxious if you miss on something.

I play games like apex legends (used to), skyrim, fallout, call of duty, witcher, dark souls, this list goes on. This game is it. It starts of very confusing but as the days go by you catch on to everything. There are clues to help you out and then you're constantly worried about your chickens and cows making sure they are fed. Definitely one of my favorites games. Honestly I think this might be my first review too.",True

413150,"🎮 Gameplay & Freedom:
Feels a bit privileged to even write a review for such a masterpiece... but here I go.
I absolutely love this game — the way you have so many options for how you want to play, and somehow all of those options feel meaningful. Every choice adds value to your experience.

✨ Play It Your Way:
Whether you’re farming, fishing, mining, building, exploring, or socializing — you can choose your own path, and it always feels rewarding.

📱 Cross-Platform Love:
I started playing on PC, and more recently, I’ve been enjoying it on mobile as well. No matter where I play, it’s a relaxing escape I can always return to.

❤️ Story & Characters:
The characters? They feel real. Their backstories are so immersive that you genuinely want to know more about them.

🧰 Automation & Late-Game:
One thing I love is how you can automate tasks that become repetitive in the late game — things like petting animals, collecting produce, and watering crops. It keeps the experience engaging even after hours of play.

📦 Inventory & Chest Management:
If I had to point out one thing I preferred in another game, it’s the chest organization. In Palia, for example, items are grouped automatically, and you can access your full inventory from any chest on your plot. I’d love to see something similar here — managing tons of chests in the late game can get overwhelming.

🎨 What Makes It Unique?
The 2D gameplay is part of its magic. It’s proof that a great game doesn’t need fancy 3D graphics to be captivating and addictive.

💰 Worth the money?
Without a doubt. This is a game I’ll keep coming back to for years.

👍 Final Verdict: 10/10 – A true gem in gaming.",True
413150,Simply put its an amazing game. It gets you in this mind set of being part of this fantastic little farming village. There is nothing quite like it - even  the many clones that are around don't quite catch this amazing athmosphere. Its well worth trying out!,True
413150,"The only thing you need to know before buying is, this game has a soul. That should be enough to buy it. Another great thing about it is, it has so much to offer, so many storylines and character arcs. It's beautifully written. It's not just a farming sim, its much more than that",True
413150,"I have spent 8 years on console versions of this game and now finally have a PC that can run it. 

My longest standing Farm is 8 years old, and i am still yet to obtain a prismatic shard but you'll wanna be the second i played on PC I'm suddenly swimming in them, because why not lol.

413150,"im so in love with this game omfg i cant put it down

413150,"Stardew Valley is an infamously wonderful and calm game with an underlying mystery of magic and war. yet it doesn't take away from the chill vibes. The Community is amazing and kind, and the company owner actually listens to their people on updates. It's cozy, and if it gets too vanilla there is hundreds of AMAZING Mods by dedicated fans to choose from to enhance it's already fun replayability. 10/10, anyone who hasn't tried it and wants a chill fun and relaxing game, you need to try this at least once.",True

413150,"A cozy game that I recommend to all looking for a relaxing game to wind down after a hard days work. The graphics are charming, the music is soothing even when in combat in the caves, the atmosphere is warm and welcoming, just a good time overall. I have yet to do everything there is to do in this game, but I look forward to exploring and finding new crops to grow, rewards to earn, and geodes to find.",True

413150,Perfect game if you want a balance of challenges and relaxation. Also allows the addition of hundreds of free mods that add significant value to the game!,True
413150,"truly the most nauseatingly flawless game i have touched. stardew valley and i grew up together, there will never be anything negative i have to communicate about the universe or any of concerned ape's decisions. (the 1.6 update announcement genuinely evoked inconsolable sobs.) commentary on consumerism and not taking anything too seriously bundled into one escapist heaven.",True
413150,"Simple, straightforward instructions. Fun characters, missions & activities. Enjoyable dialogue.",True
413150,"One of the best farm/life sim games out there, bar none.  A spiritual successor of the Harvest Moon franchise, it nails the classic vibes while providing enough new content and ideas to keep it fresh.  The sole developer for the game has been consistently adding new content, always for free, and the community behind the game is friendly and helpful to new players.  The only downside is I got hooked bad.  I go through phases where it's all I'll play.",True
413150,"Parts of this game are very good.  But the combat system is broken and it seems to be intentional (?)  You need a powerful sword to reach the bottom of Skull Cave where you'll find an item that will.... give you a powerful sword.  What's more, there are un-killable enemies in Skull Cave that (once again) you have to ignore (that doesn't keep them from killing you) so that you can reach the bottom to THEN get the good sword and THEN you can kill them, but if you reached the bottom, you no longer need to kill them.  It seems like the devs are playing a joke on the players (?)

Also, figuring the game out by yourself without looking at any internet spoilers including the wiki is all but impossible for everyone except the Try Hards with unlimited time to play. 

Once the Community Center is finished, all the fun parts of the game have been seen.  For the price, the game is totally worth it.  Just don't expect to combat to be fun or rewarding in any way.

I completely understand that some find the combat fun.  There are also plenty of people who hate it, and I understand why.",True
413150,"best game ever and great in coop too, doesn't need strong wi-fi will playing with friends, and i like how it let u  add mods to make it more beautiful",True
413150,"On a gameplay level, this game is a slow burn with huge payoffs and lots of little things for you to do. On a story level, it's pretty awesome too, with a world and moral that I think everyone needs to see and hear these days. Certainly a must play.",True
413150,"A fun and easy game for people who can't be rushed through a story. You have time to do what you want and what you enjoy, while also playing the story. It's my comfort when my other games are too competitive and I need to relax. :)",True
413150,"A very relaxing game- take the story at your own pace and discover the story of the town and its people. All the while, you will grow and build your farm the way you want! :)",True

413150,"Put all your eggs in making mayo.

The industrial friendship and environment destruction simulator, or stardew valley is a pretty good game.

Fill the water with crab pots, cover every inch of ground with identical fruit, plant diversity be dammed. Cower the earth for it's natural resources, build your empire, and make millions.

I play it a lot when I just want to unwind or de-stress from life lol. Definitely a game for anyone looking for a chill and cozy game. Plus, you can add so many mods for any of you mod lovers B).",True
413150,"I absolutely love this game! Its super cute and i would so recommend this to couples or people that like playing cosy single player games. This is filled with mysteries and lots of secrets, its also really simple to add mods and make this literally your dream farm type! ^^",True
413150,"This fun and simple farming game is full of surprises. It can be played as a simple farming simulator, but it really does offer so much insightful commentary on late-stage capitalism. You, as the farmer, will probably relish in making money and building your farm to be as profitable as possible. But you may also find yourself talking to townspeople who are struggling to make end, even with traditionally well-paying jobs. You will find townspeople unhappy that their once quaint town is full of garbage. You may even find yourself digging through the trash to fin food and valuables, despite being able to make substantial money. You may find yourself questioning if you are making the correct decisions, or if there is anything more you can do to help this community. This is a beautiful game that mimics the attitudes and concerns of small town American's with laughable accuracy.",True
413150,"Stardew Valley is, without a doubt, one of the best games ever made. I now own it on PS4, PS Vita, and Mac, and I still find myself coming back to it again and again. The game strikes a perfect balance between relaxation and engagement, offering a rewarding experience that just keeps getting better.

There’s always new content coming out, and it just enhances the gameplay even more. I love starting a new character on different farms or trying some of the challenges I see online, like the ""stay on the farm"" challenge. Each playthrough feels fresh, and there’s always a new way to approach the game.

For me, Stardew Valley is in my top 3 games of all time, and I’d highly recommend it to anyone looking for a wholesome, addictive, and rewarding experience. It is the only reason i now have a Steam Account.",True
413150,"Stardew Valley is a masterpiece that offers the perfect mixture of relaxation, creativity and adventure. From the moment you enter the invaded farm, you are immersed in a world filled with charm, comfortable aesthetics and important connections. The pixel art style is beautifully crafted, and the soothing soundtrack makes every moment feel like a warm hug.

One of the best things about Stardew Valley is its depth—there’s always something new to do! Whether it\'s growing crops, raising animals, mining for precious gems, or forming friendships with the lovable townspeople, the game constantly rewards exploration and effort. The history of stories is surprisingly deep, and each resident of the village has its own personality, its struggle and its mental events which make the city of Pelican feel alive.

The freedom to play at your own pace is what makes this game so special. Whether you are focusing on agriculture, activities, fishing, or simply decorating your home, the customisation options are endless. Even after hundreds of hours, there's still more to discover. 

Absolutely recommend!",True
413150,"This game checks all of the boxes! I was a little skeptical at first due to the graphic quality, but after spending several hours playing, I've come to love it. I love that there is no urgent quests or challenges and that you can choose how to spend your time. Such a chill game that is easy to relax to!",True
413150,its definitely a game where the player creates the gaming experience themselves. it can be high intensity and stressful or it can be cozy and relaxing (my preferred experience). ive been enjoying it very much and will probably play it through multiple times,True

It has a bit of everything - farming, combat, romance, exploration, treasure hunting, quests, achievements, secrets, mini-games, etc; and it will give back to you what you put in. If you're not a fan of the above, then you'll probably pass. But otherwise, it's very charming and the developer is still working on free updates even years down the line!",True

413150,The fact I have nearly 1k hours on this game should tell you how amazing of a game it truly is. I have countless hours on the mobile and Switch versions as well.

413150,"its pretty fun, there's always something to do or find. my boyfriend and i have been playing for like two weeks and we always find something to do or sell. Although we havemt been consistent in playing, we're still on year one. i just wish the days were longer",True

A friend of mine was kind enough to gift me this game, I'd play this game anytime I'd want as it was nice to farm when I am in the mood, I had forgotten to rate this game.

This felt like a game that was like a game, I do wonder why. Thank God I played this game, thank you for making this game, if you hadn't made this game, this game wouldn't have existed, thank God this game was created, I say and I say: Thank God this game was created. Thank God.",True
413150,"This game far exceeded my expectations and then some. Every aspect is beautiful. If I ever, by some insane chance, met Concerned Ape I'd have no choice but to offer him my firstborn because the £6.49 I spent on it in a sale is not enough to show my gratitude. These little pixels cured my anxiety I think, even though I don't sleep anymore. 1000/10.",True

413150,"One the most comfy games to play with loved ones. I have it for Switch, PlayStation, and PC. My wife isn't necessarily interested in video games, but she will play Stardew any day. One time, we were out for a business trip, and I needed to step away for a few hours. She kept busy back at the hotel playing Stardew on my Switch. I can see why it is so popular with Steamdeck. Can't wait to share with our firstborn.",True
413150,"If you have not played this yet and consider getting it, do it.
It's a very solid game with a good story-line and so many elements that allow you to customise your experience to make this whole game /your own/.
You don't care for the farming element but love fishing or exploring the mines? No problem, focus on those things that you enjoy. It will not punish you for not focusing on one part of the game-play because you enjoy the other part more.

Additionally to all of this, the community surrounding Stardew Valley is insanely welcoming and will literally pull you into it's open arms as soon as you look their way. There's an insanely active modding community aswell, not to mention the support the developer is bringing to the table aswell.

All in all an absolutely lovely game and totally worth it's money",True

takes like 2 minutes to get across the map, genuinley really annoying but everything else is really relaxing",True

From farming and fishing to raising animals and exploring different mines, there’s always something fun to do. The seasonal events keep things exciting, and playing together in multiplayer is just so much fun. I’ve put countless hours into this game across different platforms, and I’m still hooked. Truly a masterpiece!",True
413150,"Very good game, very fun and engaging, but the lack of an easy fight mode and the fact that the player is forced to combat its way through tens of levels full of mobs just to get basic metals and items doesn't make it really worth it as a cozy farming game. 6/10",True
413150,"I initially found out about the game through youtube videos, watched a few for a few days, later on the game was on sale and I bought it. Since then, I am hooked and I adore it. It's easy to befriend villagers, the community center route is truly amazing especially since you can get a keg earlier than you would otherwise. Every single one of the skills you can increase are challenging yet rewarding (mining, fishing, combat, foraging and farming). I have yet to try the Joja mart route to see what it's like. The best part is that you can easily play either solo or with up to three friends which makes the game feel fresh every single time. I highly reccomend anyone to try this game. It's worth paying for even at full price. 10/10 its worth it and if I could go back in time I would get it again in a heartbeat.",True
413150,"Been playing this game for years and it's about time I leave it a review.

Building relationships, memorable characters, cave delving, upgrade system, farming system, automation, seasons with different crops, building and decorating, goals/achievements to pursue, festivals, fishing, mining combat, great story, great music, great art style, multiplayer, island area, desert area, produce production, cooking etc etc.
It does this all so well and more

Why haven't you played it yet?",True
413150,"this is one of my favorite games to play during rough days. i love the modding community, the way the game allows you to hoard your gathered items, the slow but not too slow pace of the game and all of the different ways you can play this game. very good game would recommend.",True
413150,"Probably my favorite ""chill game"" I've played to date. Has the power to make me feel nostalgic for a place I've never been to. Great multiplayer experience too.",True

413150,"Great, calming game that you can play to just chill out. It is pretty creatively driven, but it still gives you tasks so you can play as mindlessly or as driven as you want (I could play this for hours on end). Its got a little bit of everything: story, adventure, tycoon, and more, so most people can find aspects they enjoy.

TL;DR sdv is a great game and is definitely worth the money in my opinion!",True
413150,"This game is absolutely phenomenal in every sense of the words.

According story of this game you got the big farm in Stardew valley from your grandfather. And now, when you came here, you need to revive your family estate. You can grow plants, buy animals like cows and goats. You also can fishing and mine useful fossil. If you do all of this you already can start the family and have children.

413150,"10/10 ★ This game is absolutely incredible. What isn't there to love? A cute small town where you get to learn its secrets, and enjoy the enriching stories it has to offer. There are many different farms to play, routes of game play, and marriage candidates! I love learning all the villagers' stories, and being able to create my own farm/family. I think the amount of creativity this game allows you to have along with its well-thought-out friendship/romance scenes really made me fall in love with Stardew Valley.

Honestly it is the only game i ever recommend to friends and family. The effort, love and care that has gone into creating this game shows. you will never get bored of it, and there are always new things to discover and new things to achieve (even when after getting perfection!) The characters feel authentic and the storytelling is so beautiful, and there is ALWAYS something to do or NOTHING to do depending on how you play! There is no right or wrong way of playing which is the beauty of the game, you get to play the game however you want and still experience all the the cool things about the game :)",True
413150,"If you enjoy playing Harvest Moon or Rune Factory then you will most likely enjoy playing Stardew Valley. The overall experience is fairly balanced, though the short length of each ""day"" can be a bit of an irritant.  As with any farm sim, if you can get past the initial grind of raising stamina and funds, the game opens up significantly and provides several paths to success.",True
413150,Fricking awesome game. Have 300+ hours on ps4 but bought a pc just for the new update. Only game i'm willing to buy multiple times. ConcernedApe is the best developer of all time.,True

413150,"Title: A Heartwarming, Addictive Farming Adventure - Stardew Valley Review

Stardew Valley is a true gem in the world of indie games, and it’s easy to see why it has captured the hearts of so many players, including myself. This charming farming simulator offers so much more than meets the eye, blending relaxing gameplay with a surprisingly deep and rewarding experience. I couldn’t put it down from the moment I started.

Gameplay and Mechanics: The game’s premise is simple yet addictive: inherit a rundown farm and transform it into something beautiful. But it’s the sheer variety of activities you can do that kept me coming back day after day. From planting crops, fishing, and raising animals to mining, crafting, and even building relationships with the townspeople, there’s always something to do. What I love most is how the game strikes the perfect balance between hard work and rewards — planting a crop and watching it grow, selling produce, or upgrading your farm feels so satisfying.

The daily rhythm of the game is incredibly relaxing but still offers a sense of accomplishment as you see your farm flourish. The seasons changing and the activities that come with them (like festivals, foraging, or the different crops) keep the game feeling fresh, no matter how many hours you put in.

Characters and Story: While Stardew Valley isn’t focused on a single narrative, the game’s strength lies in the town’s colorful cast of characters. Getting to know each of the villagers, building friendships (or even romancing them), and seeing how their lives unfold over time added a personal and meaningful touch to the game. I found myself looking forward to my interactions with them every day, as each character has their own quirks, backstory, and motivations.

Customization and Progression: One of the best parts of Stardew Valley is the sense of progression and customization. From designing your farm layout to choosing how to spend your time, every decision feels meaningful. The farming improvements and new areas to unlock give a sense of growth, and I loved seeing how my hard work paid off in the form of new abilities, tools, and opportunities.

Soundtrack and Atmosphere: The soothing soundtrack fits the game perfectly and adds to the overall sense of calm. The music sets the mood for each season and event, enhancing the experience. Whether I was working on my crops, exploring the mines, or simply relaxing at the local pub, the soundtrack never failed to immerse me in the world.

Overall Experience: Stardew Valley is a wonderfully wholesome experience that I recommend to anyone looking for a relaxing yet rewarding game. Whether you’re into farming sims or just want a game to get lost in, it’s a beautiful world that’s hard to leave once you’ve stepped inside. The attention to detail, the loveable characters, and the sense of community make it a must-play. It’s a game that allows you to play at your own pace, yet always feels engaging and rewarding.

If you haven’t tried it yet, do yourself a favor and start your own adventure in Stardew Valley — you won’t regret it.

*edit, ever since Im using SMAPI I never got any errors yet until at some point, I got the galaxy API failing all the times. I finally found a way to workaround that (turned out it was something to do with some Linux packages itself) and now the Steam Cloud sync doesn't work properly. Been playing for over 200 hours yet the steam cloud just stuck at 88+ hours. Been looking for a way to fix it but none prevail. Regardless, the game itself is fine and I lose nothing on any of my progress, just a little bit of annoyance because I can't really see how much time Ive spent on this game properly.",True
413150,"I play this game a lot with my friends and it's always a bunch of fun. There's always something new for me to discover and so much for me to do.

413150,I have been going through a burnout from playing multiple games back to back and went on a gaming hiatus for months but this game brought back the passion in me.

413150,"A very fun heartfelt, cozy game. Beautiful soundtrack and atmosphere.",True
413150,"Although initially I was put off by its cutesy nature, like Terraria in spirit, this game is clearly a passion-project: well-balanced, full of well-developed systems and stories to engage in, none of which feel incomplete. Plenty of hours spent tending my fields in this relaxed game. This is high on my list of chill games",True
413150,"This game is absolutely fantastic. Such a cozy, simple, and yet deep and immersive game. I can't recommend it enough.

",True
413150,"It's really just a a fun game that is everything rolled into one game-relaxing, still makes you think at times, adventurous, funny, with some serious, gut wrenching, though provoking things thrown in.",True
413150,I'm not even exaggerating when I say this is one of the best games I've ever played. I've been playing this game since I was 12 years old and I've never once gotten tired or bored of it. I recommend this game HEAVILY!!,True
413150,"a lot of fun. 
its a very calm game if you are not into fast moving games 
100% the best",True
413150,exceptional game for the price. Perfect for a chill evening.,True
413150,"I love getting to just relax after a hard day by playing this game. The creator is awesome too, and listens to the community. Honestly just peak.",True
413150,I have played countless hours on my switch and have never actually finished and only got to ginger island once but i keep on playing! Had to get it on steam <3,True
413150,A cozy game with a soothing soundtrack that is great for winding down or simply escaping into for a few minutes or hours at a time.,True
413150,Chill game with minimal time management. Lots of little things that you learn each time you play.,True
413150,"its very relaxing, I often feel like I'm always finding something new to do in the game",True
413150,"Long story short, this game is just so wonderful. It has a bit of everything, sword fights, monsters, everyday life, romance, farming, love and friendship, and more! If you want even more, it's very easy and fun to mod, or to even make mods yourself. 100/10, as I've bought it for my husband, and for myself 2x (On the switch and PC). I hope you give this game a try!",True
413150,"The game is so much more than just watering crops - there is so much content it's honestly insane. The game is also pretty chill, you don't have to restart the game 10 days in because of a small mistake(like i did like 3 times lmao). You aren't forced into doing anything. Don't like farming? Try fishing. Don't like that? Try foraging or mining or fighting or just doing nothing and walking around. The characters seem pretty deep too and the game is still getting updates. I can 100% see myself spending quite a bit of time in this game.",True
413150,"Stardew Valley is that game you pick up for “just 30 minutes,” and suddenly it’s 2 AM. Whether you're farming, fishing, or just vibing with the townsfolk, it’s the perfect mix of cozy and addictive. ✨",True

Leah is more attractive than real women",True

413150,Simple but fun. I have 300+ hours on my Xbox and I very much adore this game. It's very laid back but can keep you busy for hours with plenty to do and lots to obtain. Highly recommend for anyone looking for something easy but fun.,True
413150,Far better as a co-op game. It won't quite scratch the Harvest Moon itch but it is good enough to play with friends chatting and dividing the game play to focus on the parts we each like.,True
413150,"It has everything you could need. Farming, Foraging, Mining, and Fighting. Totally Recommended.",True
413150,Love the retro graphics and that I am always being challenged to uncover something new,True

The more you gift to the characters in the game, the more you learn about them",True
413150,"Stardew Valley: The Most Stressful Relaxing Game You'll Ever Play

Imagine this: You escape the soul-crushing repetition of corporate life to inherit your grandpa’s rundown farm, expecting a peaceful, simple existence. Next thing you know, you're juggling crops, livestock, mining, fishing, fighting monsters, wooing villagers and single-handedly taking down a soulless megacorporation, all while an old man in a wizard hat spies on you from the woods.  

Stardew Valley pretends to be a chill farming game, but let’s be real, it's a capitalist pressure cooker in overalls. You start off thinking, “I’ll just plant some parsnips.” Then suddenly, you’re obsessing over optimal sprinkler placement, min-maxing ancient fruit profits and panicking because you forgot Mayor Lewis’s birthday (again).  

The villagers? They’re either delightful or deeply unhinged. You can befriend them, date them and even marry them, but fair warning: some of them have baggage heavier than a full backpack in Skull Cavern. (Looking at you, Shane.)  

And let’s talk about time. There’s never enough of it! You’ll wake up with big plans, get distracted by a truffle-hunting pig, and then realize it’s 2 AM and your farmer just collapsed in the dirt like a college student during finals week.  

But despite all this, Stardew Valley is weirdly, beautifully addictive. It's a pixelated love letter to hard work paying off, with a soundtrack so soothing it could calm a caffeinated squirrel. It’s part farming sim, part dungeon crawler, part small-town soap opera, and somehow, it all just works.  

10/10. Would lose track of my real-life responsibilities again.",True
413150,Super cozy game. I could play this for hours and not get bored.. I love this game. <3,True
413150,"Actually the best game ever created, hands down. I have played 250+ hours on console and PC combined, across almost every patch, and still always come back to play the game periodically. Great multiplayer experience. The developer is amazing (this game is just one guy's passion project) and still updates the game, even while working on a new one. Perfect pickup for all players, regardless of how hardcore or casual, this game has something for everyone to enjoy :)",True
413150,If you are looking for a fun farming sim to to chill and relax then this game is for you. I am very addicted to the game right now. It is even more of a blast with mods.,True
413150,One of the best game to play! really nostalgic and great for new players,True
413150,"I started playing this game early 2022 when I was battling with depression. It gave me a sense of purpose in a way. I live in the city in real life, tending to my crops and having this peaceful and simple country life brought me back to sanity. Stardew Valley saved me from myself - it became my home.",True
413150,"This is one of the best video games I have come across, especially as a multiplayer game. It's lighthearted and fun. You can pick it up and play for a little or a long time. It has great potential with mods (although I don't use many or often).

413150,It's super great and fun! I enjoy every minute I'm playing this. :D,True
413150,"This is primarily a farming, mining, and fishing game via flavour text. In one player mode it can be easily paused at any point though a two player day cannot be paused, and saving happens at the end of each day with no option to save in the middle. It is a soothing relaxed game that I have played through many times. It ""ends"" after 2 years game time though you can continue with the save as long as you want (I think). It has  interesting and realistic characters with some magic thrown in. There is no need to optimize or achieve everything, though there are also fun unique awards for doing so.",True
413150,"Easily the MOST replayable game I've ever played. I've played Vanilla (no mods) since I bought the game, so yes at this point I've spent 921 hours without mods, just playing as it was meant to be. Trying to play with a friend who has mods and now I've delved into the world of modding.... pray for me lol. I hope this expands the world for me, and continues to hold its replay value!",True
413150,This is my favorite game right now. Just a really nice way to build a farm. I can choose to be a hermit and not interact very much with the community and just farm. It is awesome!!,True
413150,actual most fun game in the history of ever especially in multiplayerilovelovelvoeloveloveloveloveloveovelovelovelove this game,True

413150,"Stardew Valley continues to hold up as a great single player and multiplayer game. The story is cute and the game play is simple, with plenty of options for customization. Each of the many times I have started a farm in this game, I try different strategies and play with other options. Truly a delight!",True
413150,"A very fun and well rounded game. Lots of opportunites to choose your own path (farming, mining, combat, social, etc). I like the base game's characters and NPC storylines. Each playthrough feels different but still cozy and familiar. The modding community and speed running community is HUGE too so there are lots of ways to keep it fresh and fun. Very age appropriate for kids, and approachable for newbies.

413150,"probably the most popular farming game, played with a friend but mostly enjoyed mining. A good game for casual gamers and those interested in farming games",True
413150,"Very enjoyable and relaxing game. One of the few games i enjoyed playing the past couple of years, and one of the very few singleplayer games in that regard. It reminds me of Harvest Moon, which i used to play when i was a child, so maybe im a little biased. It feels like a lot of love was put into that game. The only thing that bugs me a bit about it is that it is almost necessary to permanently use the wiki if you dont want to waste hundred if not thousand of hours in figuring stuff out for yourself. I can see how it is fun to figure the game out for yourself, but sadly i don't have the time anymore. But it is a very minor thing, would still highly recommend it - 5/5

",True
413150,"I love this game so much it is truly so wonderful and fun. there is so much story too it and it is far more than just a farming game. the number of things you can discover through finding secrets, building relationships, and doing quests is incredible.

413150,"Fun low-stress game in which to get immersed. Great for when I was feeling depressed, and has so many different things you could do that it was endlessly entertaining! But if you get frustrated, just make sure you look up the wiki so you feel a little more grounded",True
413150,its like working in the fields again but fun,True
413150,great game. i love the different routes and storys you can find in the game. each time i play on a different farm i learn something new or im trying new techniques to see what works better. I even had a friend join in just so we could upgrade their home  for an additional cellar,True

413150,"It's good chill ass fun, especially since the world is burning to the ground.",True
413150,"This game is absolute gold. It's got lots to do for people who are invested in story-telling, speed-running, farming sims, or just casual gaming. It's very rewarding learning about a characters story and interacting with the world around the player, the NPCs feel very realistic. It's also a game someone could come back to after months or even years, since it's really replayable. There's always a new route a person can take.

10/10! This game is worth the money spent.",True
413150,"Best game Ive ever played so much fun. Played mostly on Xbox but, its the best feeling ever to progress in this game. Makes me want to be a farmer.",True

413150,"Great game, so much to do and discover. played for a couple years on different systems and only feel like ive scratched the surface.",True
413150,"amazing game, bought on switch, xbox, xbox(pc), and now steam. game itself has many calming aspects from farming, fishing, foraging, and building your farm in your image. Iv'e been modding the game recentlty and the gasme only get more interesting with different mods to make things less difficult, and to add more things to do. all in all 10/10 game.",True
413150,"Easily my favorite game of all time. Have bought it 3 different times for 3 different devices and don't regret it one bit. The amount of love and attention that went into this game is incomparable to any other platformer on the market. If you're looking for a satisfying and relaxing game to spend countless hours in (I currently have over 1000+ hours over all my saves and I am STILL discovering new things I didn't know), look no further. ConcernedApe, you da man.",True
413150,"Probably one of the most chill games I have ever played. Lots and lots of things to do but you won't get easily overwhelmed because of its friendly approach to new players. Has a wholesome community to ask for help as well. Playing alone can be fun and relaxing but sometimes having friends to play with is what makes it better.

Recommended.",True
413150,its pretty addictive ive had it happen multiple times where i load it up at a reasonable time and check the time and its very late despite feeling like barely any times passed but i love it,True
413150,"It's amazing once you get into the rhythm of it. I've 100%'d it and still want to play more.
fortunately there are a lot of mods!",True
413150,"Fun game to play with friends / Family members. Not fast paced, take your time. A lot of variation and different approaches to how you want to make money",True
413150,"A relaxed, casual game which is fun whilst being a challenge.  Lots of rewards and achievements which sometimes require patience.  Love the multiplayer capability.  Recommended.",True
413150,Chill farming game with lots of different options and it is very well polished. The farming RPG aspect of it is very good and I'm thoroughly enjoying my time. Will keep playing and definitely keep improving my farm. Makes me think of what to do every single day and how to properly manage my time.,True
413150,"I honestly just love how this game plays, it's challenging and sometimes easy to over think your days. There is always so much to do but you can really set your own place to your farm life as well. Getting to know the Town folk and remembering all the events. So much to do, I love it.",True
413150,"You can either contribute to capitalism by expanding an already massive corporation, or help Pierre. There is no winning. Fantastic game btw",True
413150,"Great game to chill with. Nothing but farming and mini quests
",True
413150,This is the best game to relax and de-stress. There's just one problem: there's a bug that makes Robin married to the worst NPC in the game. I hope Eric Barone fixes this in the next patch.,True
413150,"This game is fun, peaceful,and comforting though gets a little boring when you play alone, the updates on this game are astounding and all the effort the creator put into this cannot be understated.",True
413150,"A mysterious game that empowers those who play it. The OST is like a dream... a powerful personal experience, yet difficult to describe to others.

Favorite of mine, 12/10",True
413150,This game is amazing! So fun and very wholesome with great quests to keep you hooked for hours!,True
413150,"Absolutely amazing game.  As someone who dislikes combat in cozy games, this one balances and rewards it quite well.  The only thing I dislike about this game is the yellow color palate, it can be rough on the eyes.  However, with mods that can easily be fixed.",True
413150,"cute farming game with lots of fun side stuff to do other then farming
it does get boring at the end game and does lack a lot of re-play value but its still lots of fun the very first few times playing it",True
413150,"A lovely game that clearly has a lot of passion behind its years of work. I had bought it out of impulse just about a year ago now, knowing absolutely nothing whatsoever. That was one of the best decisions I've made. A game like this deserves to be in its position.

Stardew Valley is one of those games I'll keep coming back to.",True
413150,"I´ve spent more time with this game than any other. Even when I eventually grow tired of it for a while, I always come back and start a new save. It´s incredibly impressive how many things have been added and improved over time. I can´t recomment Stardew Valley enough!",True
413150,Super relaxing game. Great way to sink some time. Easy to play in short spurts and is self guided so you can do whatever you want basically whenever you want. There is a rabbit hole to go down if you really want to get deeper into the game as well. Highly recommend the game to anyone of any age.,True
413150,"Love this game! There can be strategy to it, but it's hilarious and a little dark. Highly recommend!",True
413150,Best farming simulation game out there with a band of quirky characters to romance and befriend,True
413150,"This is old news by now but Stardew Valley is obviously a great game. Its wonderful for escapism purposes, and I've been leaning on it pretty heavily for that reason over the last couple months. It is a cozy game and not terribly difficult, but there's enough going on to keep it interesting - it's not merely a farming simulator. That said, there's not pressure to ""progress,"" and potential goals of progression aren't even necessarily laid out for you so there's very little pressure to do anything you don't enjoy. If you want it just to be a farming simulator while you try to get as rich as possible - go for it! If you like fighting in the mines, that's an option, too! There's really no wrong way to play, and a lot of right ones.

I've played this both on my phone with the app, and now on my laptop. Both work very well, though the UI is slightly different to suit the different formats. I would say that overall, computer is slightly easier, since things are a lot bigger, but I do miss the free zooming and point-and-click style of movement in some scenarios.",True
413150,This game is an absolutely amazing game. I absolutely recommend this game to someone who wants chill and have some fun. But it is fun for anyone anyways. 10/10,True
413150,"This game is possibly one of the most entertaining, complex games whilst still remaining relaxing and low pressure. It's definitely worth the money. I got it for 10 or 11 dollars when it was for sale as I didn't know too much about it but now i can confidently say that it is definitely in my top 5 favorite games of all time.",True
413150,"Good game and replyability, however the contrasts of this game make it really inaccessible for some. It's super hard to properly see what's on the screen, even without visual impairment that makes me struggle with contrasts.

You have to watch out to not go into minmaxing mode and stress yourself out with trying to raise efficiency of every process to 100%",True
413150,This game is so moreish. There is just so much content to discover and so many ways to play. Brilliant mix of cosy game with strategy and just enough panic to keep it interesting.,True
413150,"Such a great farm sim. It has quests, farming, little bit of magic and lots of fun. The single guy who made this is a genius. Such a masterpiece of a game!",True
413150,"Have had a blast playing this game. I've played through spring a couple too many times and YouTube likes to recommend every video about it on the planet. There should be some good 8 player speed runs of this game eventually. Also, all of the fan art for this game is rather good too. 11/10 would play again and probably will continue to play. I'll have to play it with my future wife and future children too.",True
413150,"This is a great game for multiplayer as well as single player. With multiple pathways to get through the game, I believe each player and each time you play will result in different experiences. With 258 hours under my belt I can safely say I highly recommend it. I think the worst part is fighting cave monsters and being forced to sleep every day, but I believe more complex saving or fighting mechanisms would not have achieved the version of the game that exists here and now at this price point and the level of entertainment. I would additionally say this is safe enough for a child to play depending on their reading level, as there is no voice-over in the base game to my knowledge",True
413150,"Its very addicting in its gameplay once you really get into the thick of it. You're very rarely short of things to do, and you always feel like you want to complete them before putting down the game.",True
413150,"its just peaceful and relaxing, good game, very fun if you dont have it get it on sale, i had a friend gift it to me. 10/10 good stuff",True
413150,"Favorite game of all time, if you like anything related to cozy lifestyle farming games this hits the mark. If you like grinding, planning, and min maxing your way through daily progressions this is definitely for you. Worth its price ten fold. ConcernedApe graced us with several major updates through the years and doesn’t bother asking for a penny more. GOAT game, can’t wait for Haunted Chocolatier.",True

413150,Stardew valley is a really fun game i would recommend for ages can read and understand things and up. I love this game it has so many things to discover and explore. It also has a cool retro pixel feeling while keeping the game new. Stardew is also an afodable unlike some other games. I and many other players love the sound track it gets you in the feeling to play some stardew I am actully saving up to get the records. This game never ends and always has new suprices I recomend and I won't spoile anything eles get this game and have fun.,True
413150,"The best and only game i like to play, came to play with friends stayed for Sebastian.",True
413150,"super chill and definately a good if not the best introduction to cozy games as a whole. It's pretty cheap for the loads of content it has, and it's especially nice to have a dedicated dev and a wonderful fandom. Even if you don't like slow paced (it isn't that slow paced like ACNH, one day is around 14 minutes) there's an active speedrunning community too. 10/10. The best feature is farming but the worst feature is combat. Even so the caves are pretty fun to play.",True
413150,Its a fun farming game with lots of things to do and story!,True
413150,"I love this game, played many more hours on switch and xbox. I love it enough to have bought it 3 times. It is utterly ridiculous that after all this time there aren't options on the main menu.",True
413150,"Relaxing, cozy farm simulator with fun story lines. The quality of life add-ons since release are great and really improve things. There are SO many ways to play the game and you don't have to try to achieve anything unless you want to.",True
413150,"is good game, would game more, will game more, video game mmmmm.",True
413150,Honestly my favorite game to date. I love their NPCs and the funny dialogue options. It's extremely deep for what it appears to be and that adds another layer for any older audiences looking for interesting story.,True
413150,Good game to chill. Sometimes it doesn't tell you how you have to do things tho.,True
413150,amazing game to play to feel like ur doing smth w ur life without rly doing anything. i would like to thank concernedape for giving me a chance to meet my wife (haley) and a chance to be beaten to death by the skull cavern's green flying snakes. life is worth living chat,True

413150,"all about it is amazing, there's always more to do and discover, and Sebastian is my soul mate. No one else can have him. Other then that, stardew valley is great.",True
413150,played it for 25 hours got bored of singleplayer and then forcibly gave it to my friend that got mad at me for gifting it best 10/10 would do it again,True
413150,"very good game, chilling farming fame with a lot of things to do, i can play it over and over",True
413150,"Slept on this game for years, but finally picked it up because I was bored of basically everything else.  And wow, it has quickly become one of my favorite games.  Really wish I had bought it sooner.  I thought I would hate the repetitive farming aspect of it, but it oddly became quite addicting, quite quickly.  Establishing a daily routine of tending to the crops, growing the farm, maintaining relationships, and adventuring was unreasonably satisfying once I got into one.  All thanks to the insanely detailed and picturesque word, and characters that I instantly became attached to.  

Also, it's unfathomably based and has been so refreshing.  Ending up happily married with two kids and two dogs, on a $4M farm funded by cheese and truffle oil is a level of video game contentment I had yet to imagine.  Not only can you pet the dog, but you can kiss the wife and bounce the babies.  Like seriously, other video games, why can't I do that in your relationships?  I used to be fine with Skyrim marriage, but this is my new standard.  

All in all, this game is 10/10.  Will keep playing, and then play again.  It is so obvious that this game was made with an incredible amount of love, care, and attention to detail.  Huge, huge, props to ConcernedApe for making something this special.

P.S: I am currently modding the game too, and it has totally dialed the fun up to 11.  If it wasn't obvious already, I know without a doubt that there is hundreds of hours of quality gameplay to be had here.",True
413150,"Love this game, it s very cozy and fun specially playing with a friend, love it",True
413150,"I love how there´s a lot to do but its also forgiving so you can go at your own pace. I love everything about this game, to be honest, from the story to the characters to every little corner of this world. It´s my comfort game",True
413150,This is a peaceful farming game with easy tasks that can be completed each season. It allows for a stress free gaming experience as long as you are not in the Skull caves. Good luck.,True
413150,"i would recommend this game to anyone who wants to enjoy a cute adventerous self directed play through. Perfect to wind down after a big day!!
",True
413150,"Its a super fun relaxing game and you can do farming, minng, collect stuff, fish, and talk to characters all around the map! highly suggest  for sure.",True
413150,"Stardew is a amazing Isekai based game; that while has several things to motivate you through the game it also has a slow enough pace that it could be considered relaxing. Fun as single, or co-op mode,",True
413150,"I've been looking for the perfect nostalgic cozy game, and my favorite games growing up were harvest moon, animal crossing, pokemon and minecraft. This, this is that. It's perfect. I have unintentionally put 120 hours solid into this game and i've only had it for 2 weeks. 

I love Stardew Valley.",True

413150,A perfect farming game. Highly addictive with lots of secrets to uncover,True
413150,"I loved fishing more than anything in this game, and in a way it reminded me of lockpicking in Skyrim (it feels just as rewarding). For me, it was one of the few games in which each gaming session lasted a mind-boggling six hours, because I tried to complete half of each season (14 out of 28 in-game days) in one sitting. When I was buying the game, I thought it would be stress-free, but it turned out to be quite the opposite, because you only have so much time and energy to complete every task on any given day; some of the tasks slip your mind while others you simply fail to complete in time. So it can get quite hectic if you are a yes-man like me who takes on every task from the bulletin board.",True
413150,"I've only played this game for 4 hours because i don't have the goddamn time to play but so far i love this game, I can't really say anything other than that since i haven't spent hundreds of hours like the rest of ya'll. I'm looking forward to beat this game and 100 percenting it in the spring break when i have time.

I guess other than that it just blows my mind that this game, That was made only by one person with a small desk managed to be the 17th most sold game OF ALL TIME, It gets to compete with successful indie titles like terraria and minecraft (except minecraft is no longer indie). Anyway, Huge W to eric barone.",True
413150,"Coming late to the party - attention to details is nice but honestly I heard so much hype over this game and the controls are wonky and buggy af when aiming for the grid. 
9/10 considering its made by one dev.
6/10 considering how long it had to be polished.",True
413150,"The best game if you are a little bit into everything! It's a farming/life sim and has hackslash game elements to give the best of both worlds! I love how it's an open world, but there is still a main storyline that you can complete at your own pace. A top 5 for me for sure.",True
413150,This is my absolute favorite game! It's so cozy and the mines also allow for adventure!,True
413150,This is a really cute game about farming and community. It has a ton of characters with real and deep stories and plenty to do. Definitely a classic. If you have any questions about the game definitely comment and I'll respond with some answers.,True

413150,Its a fun game for the price you will get hours of fun relaxing game play reminiscent of games of harvest moon and such.,True
413150,"I grew up with Harvest Moon so when this game was released I was stoked. It's everything you want from a little farming game with top down Zelda elements. The hours speak for itself and the new update has only added to that. If you got some time to kill and want to be sucked in, get this game.",True
413150,"Great game for zoning out. I love being able to just farm. I also am trying to 100% the game and they have made is extremely modable, so I LOVE it. I have played on Xbox for over 200 hours so I am glad to have fun on my laptop.",True
413150,"Calm and relaxing, and very fun. The in-game storyline is very engaging",True

i love farming too ig",True
413150,"Stardew valley is one of my favorite comfort games. Every couple months I see myself come back to start a new farm and go down a different path, always finding new ways to play and more content I hadn't previously explored. Since the addition of multiplayer, it's been a blast to play until late at night with friends, always trying to get a little more play time in before bed. This game was made by a solo developer who clearly put a lot of love, blood, sweat and tears into it, and the continual updates keep making the game better and better. Looking forward to seeing what ConcernedApe creates next!",True

413150,"This is the most addicting game I think I have ever played. Between PC and Switch, I have played this game for over 1000 hours and I still find myself going back to complete different quests, try new farm maps, and strive to achieve 100%, despite already having done it on my Switch save. The simple graphics, excellent music, and colorful cast of characters that I have grown to know and care (or not care) for all bring me into its own world and keep me trapped for at least two hours at a time. Stardew Valley is the first cozy farm sim that I have played and it will forever be special and nostalgic.",True
413150,"It's one of those rare games where I just genuinely don't think I could find bad things to say. It's a grind but not an unconquerable one, it rewards effort. The automation of your farm and all the goods you can make keeps you engaged in the long run. The people in town are engaging and the suitors are entertaining if a bit lacking in depth at some points. Overall its up to you what you want this game to be and I've had a great time.",True

413150,"Stardew Valley is an amazing game that immerses you in a cozy world of farming and peaceful life. I really enjoy growing crops, taking care of the farm, and building relationships with the villagers. The ability to start a family adds warmth and comfort to the gameplay, though I wish there were more interactions with your spouse and children to make family life feel deeper.

The atmosphere and soundtrack are truly wonderful — it feels like you’re being transported to another world where you can forget about everyday worries and just enjoy the moment. It’s the perfect game for anyone looking for tranquility and a pleasant way to spend their time. 🌿",True
413150,I have 900 hours in the base game alone. The game will speak for itself if you just give it a chance. A 10/10 game that gets better with mods but is great on its own.,True

413150,In the time I've played Stardew Valley mainly on the Play Station 4 I've grown to enjoy the simple graphics of the game along with the overall vibe it gives and i would gladly play this forever,True
413150,"In fact, I feel very confused about this game.
How to put it, I actually play for much longer than the time shown on Steam, at least several thousand hours.
I love this game, enjoy its leisurely pace, appreciate its freedom, and like being able to talk to the villagers without bringing in the deceit from reality. Getting married to an NPC of the opposite sex doesn't worry about being betrayed.
I also play Terraria and Minecraft. However, although both are pixel games, my computer can handle many entities in Terraria, and even harvesting a large amount of crops does not affect the game performance. But in Stardew Valley, when I plant too many crops and harvest them, or spray monster perfume in the skull cave to kill monsters, the game will keep freezing. Even worse, the game will crash and exit.
As mentioned above, I am annoyed by the game crashing repeatedly. Like today, the game crashed more than ten times, which greatly affects my gaming experience. I don't know how the entity of Stardew Valley operates, but this issue can be considered for proper resolution by the author.",True

10/10.",True
413150,One of the greatest solo and co-op games out there. The perfect amount of calming repetition and exciting action. There are so many easter eggs and story building moments that bring the town to life. Every character is unique. Concerned Ape really shows how a passion project of one man can beat out games from the largest of companies. It's truly a magnum opus.,True
413150,"I've played this game for years. It's absolutely a must if you grew up playing games like harvest moon. There's a lot of amazing aspects of the game, but I really love how unique each love interest is along with their heart events. I enjoy farming my crops and watching the cash roll in during blueberry season. 
Mods can be added to enhance the game play. I'm definitely going to be playing this game for many more years.",True
413150,"It's the best $15 you'll ever spend in your life. I love it it so much that I bought it on the Switch too.

The fact that the creator of the game regularly adds new free dlc is amazing.  The modding community is great too and there are so many mods that let you customize your experience",True

It was complete shit on release. 
Now, it is not even good. 
It is great. I love it. Definitely one of the best games of all time.

DO NOT PLAY WITHOUT PHANTOM LIBERTY",True
1091500,"I usually skip on playing action shooter games, that’s why I wasn’t that hyped when Cyberpunk was being released. It will haunt me forever to know that was it not for the Edgerunners anime, I would most likely not play this game at all. Missing out on this gaming jewel would truly be tragic. I am not being hyperbolic, the only critique I have for this game is the limited romance options, but I will spare everyone the several paragraphs about how unfair it is not being allowed to romance Viktor Vektor and Goro Takemura. To be completely honest, it is not even that big of a deal. In fact while the romance part of this game is cute, it could be skipped entirely without it taking away from the absolute perfection this game is.

What is so good about this game then? Well… kind of everything. 

Let’s start with world building, the year is 2077, future is here and almost everyone you meet on the street has some sort of cyber enhancement installed in their body. You are introduced to Night City, a brutal environment with several gangs plaguing each part of the city. I won’t spoil any part of the game in this review, but you are SHOWN just how dangerous this city is right from the very start, your first encounter, first mission. The characters, even those that only appear ever so often are wonderfully crafted with their own personalities and problems, making them unforgettable.

That brings us to narration, the main story left me giggling, ugly crying, gasping and staring with open mouth at the screen, I don’t remember the last time a game spurred this many different emotions within me. The dialogues are filled with witty lines and apart from your attitude and tone you use with people, there are choices to be made. Some will affect the outcome of a situation, some you might regret later. You are not pressured to follow the main story, in fact I have spent hours hunting side gigs and objectives before dedicating time to the main story. Even if not accompanied by ‘cutscenes’, the side gigs do offer a peek into the lore of the world you are in, they might even reveal things aren’t as they were presented to you. Of course due to the sheer number of these missions, some will be nothing more than a fetch quest with a little bit of extra story. I still found doing these enjoyable, probably for the sole reason of the freedom of choice. How do you want to do this? Enter guns blazing, grenades rolling, clean up the house to steal what you need? Or would  you rather sneak in, distract the guards and jump out of the window once you are done? Up to you.

 
So how is the combat? Incredibly satisfying. The options might even be a little overwhelming in the beginning. Do you want to hack or slash? Watch the chaos you sow erupt from the distance or bring the heat right to the gonk’s faces? There is abundance of weapons you can find or buy to suit any type of play style you like and if you don’t like weapons at all, you can make do with hacking the enemies’ cyberware or get a spicy little whip installed in your forearms. 

Equipped with whatever suits your fancy you get to explore the city and its surroundings, while you do get to fast travel and use other means of travel like cars or bikes, I often ran through the city by foot, there are so many places to discover, so many side quests, tidbits of lore or interesting weapons you might stumble upon. 

I do have to mention, however, that since the very… unfortunate… launch of this game, of which I heard about even if I wasn’t intending to play back then, there are still glitches and bugs. I did not encounter any game breaking ones and managed with a quick google search, but I do have a piece of advice - don’t lose yourself in the side gigs, whenever you have yellow side mission available - do those first. A lot of them are locked behind waiting for someone to call you, and I spent a long time trying to trigger this with no more side gigs available. 

And that is it my chooms, the past few weeks I have spent thinking about nothing else but Cyberpunk and now it is time to set the game down. I’ve completed what I wanted, looked up secrets I missed on my crawl through the Night City. But worry not, I have about fifty unreasonably long YouTube videos I shoved into my watch later playlist, analyzing all parts of the game to cope. I’ll be back for the DLC, until then - contract closed.",True
1091500,"Story is very good on the base game but in the Phantom Liberty it becomes great. I played the game when it first released on PS4, I can say it was the worst experience then but now I played it on update 2.22 and its one of the great game I can say at least on PC it is running like its a tech demo. I am playing with RT and its a treat to my eyes on night, In day time you will not notice it much but in nigh its a totally different story. if you are not getting FPS try FSR 3.1 Frame Gen Mod its works great if you have locked 60 FPS then with this mod you can get around 120 FPS with RT. I have around 150 screenshot taken because of how good it looks. Get the Game with the DLC guys its a must. Hoping there would be sequel to this game",True
1091500,"I've played through this game a few times over and each time i get more connected to this world.
With games you'd think once you figured out the mechanics you'd start min-maxxing and skipping dialogue you've already heard but not with Cyberpunk.

I started paying more attention to quests. Then I started doing what my character would do not just what I thought would get me the best outcome. Five playthroughs later I find my self reading every data shard, checking every terminal, and blasting all the songs.

I'm not gonna explain what this game and the cyperpunk genre means to me because I can't.
Just know you'll love this game no matter what...
but if you take your time, if you really take it all in and open your soul to it

there's a deep catharsis to be found in this world that doesn't care",True
1091500,"10/10 game

• Amazing story
• Great gameplay (for a shooter)
• Gorgeous graphics and great optimisation. (Path tracing is playable with a 4070 at 1080p/DLSS. 45-60 fps in most areas. With mods that reduce bounces, could go even higher with minimal fidelity loss)
• City and level design is one big eye candy.

Only drawback is no optional third person, but the immersion in first person is top tier. Played this game since 1.3, so seeing the problematic child finally grow up to be a star was almost tear jerking.",True
1091500,"I got the base game along with phantom liberty DLC, and the length of the game was extensive. The quests just don't stop coming. This game has 13 alternate endings, mind you. Many choices. Graphics are great. no more bugs like at the launch of the game. Many memorable characters. Enough memorable quests. Game makes you to invest in it. But the gameplay is chill and relaxing. it is a technical achievement and also a great RPG.",True
1091500,"Bought it first time way back when it launched, it ran crappily even at potato graphics so I refunded. Fast forward to the game's patch 2.21, bought on sale. I can now play the game without frustration. I wish the draw distance and lighting in vanilla was better (though these can somewhat be adjusted to liking via mods).

Fun large map lots of things to do. Find your own fun delving into different styles of combat. 
Are you the cool stealthy ninja? Or are you Rambo? Or perhaps a sniper? or mayber a glance at people and fry their cybernetics as a netrunner? Or go cyberpsycho?

Plenty of mods abound as well if you want to spice things up. 

Storywise - No spoilers here, writing makes sense, character development shown. Nothing forced. Pacing could be better but it does not feel rushed nor sluggish. Wish there were some follow-ups to see the consequences of some choices ala Witcher 3. Wish there were some other choices available when it logistically makes sense as well.

Voice acting is amazing and brings the characters to life. Keanu is breathtaking as well.

1091500,"It's no secret. 
Cyberpunk 2077 had a rocky launch, being mostly unfinished - [b]HOWEVER;[/b] CD Projekt Red has DELIVERED in the years post-launch.
[h3]Cyberpunk 2077 is the best game I've played since Skyrim released back in 2011.[/h3]
The DLC: Phantom Liberty is a work of art, and the ending credits gives me goosebumps every time I hear [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u15tEo0wsQI]Dawid Podsiadło's song ""Phantom Liberty"".[/url]
If you're looking for an open world, singleplayer, sci-fi shooter with some of the best world building I've ever seen - this is your sign to bite the bullet and purchase both the base game and the DLC. The experience from playing it once is worth the game's full price. If you're lucky to catch it on a sale I wouldn't even hesitate.

If I had the chance to go back and relive any game from the beginning, [b]this[/b] is the game I would choose. I envy the journey you're about to embark on. [i]Have fun, choom.[/i]",True
1091500,"way better than at launch, super interactive and leaves no corner of the city without something to do",True
1091500,"I know the game came out messy, but it's really worth giving this game a chance today. It is an amazing game in everything from graphics to the story.So many different, and intresting characters that u get to meet all over night city. 

Promise u will have a great time with the game today",True
1091500,"Good gameplay, good story, good characters.",True
1091500,"Phenomenal game.
Yes, the story can be hard to follow.
Yes, the morality system (why knock people out?), the stealth gameplay (why hide bodies?), the character customisation (why can't I look like Jackie, Susie Q, or Maelstrom lol), the romance, trauma team, street cred (people should be afraid of me) etc. were all half-baked and clearly the Mox were going to be more important in the original scope and plans. But it shows how good the game is when all of this doesn't really matter or affect my view on it.

The gameplay is incredible. Truly amazing stuff. There is a triple combo that really allows for unique playstyles. 
1- cyberware
2- class-type skill trees
3- weapon type skills
 
On my first run I was a borged-out nomad netrunner-tank of a man, wielding nothing but a charge-shotgun with two barrels and a heart of hatred. The gameplay was on the highest difficulty but I still felt like Robocop. Blasting the shit outta gonks close range and blowing the brain-chips up of fools across the map with my quickhacks.

On my second run I was a double-jumping, quick-dashing mantis-blade streetkid woman that specialised in throwing knives, sniper rifles, pistols, and chopping fools up with my mantis blades. I had no ability to hack, and relied on a berserk booster for melee. This was an entirely different style of gameplay and is truly incredible the devs have built a system where it works and flows as naturally as it does. If I do a third run I'll play as a smart-gun, rifle-focused corpo. 

The open world is amazing, absolutely beautiful and with tonnes of detail. It truly defends its right to be open world with the NCPD scanner and gigs/jobs. It's a shame it doesn't have as much interactable establishments in any meaningful way (like eg. the Yakuza games) but still far better than 90% of open world games out there. I'd say as far as the map goes it is actually the best I have ever played. No Far Cry, Days Gone, Mad Max, Yakuza, GTA, Sleeping Dogs or whatever really gets close. This is something special.

The story is great, it's a decent foundation that is launched to its peak by the performances of its (voice)actors. This also applies to phantom liberty. The characters are well written and it punches where it needs to. It doesn't forget the PUNK of cyberpunk; even if the ""morals"" the story sort-of forces in your face are a bit dubious at best.

Overall, this game is definitely worth picking up. Especially considering you can get it at 50% off quite frequently. Make sure to get the one with Phantom Liberty as imho that expansion has an ending that is absolute cinema. 

So yes, TLDR:
GOATed story
GOATed open world design
GOATed side content
GOATed gameplay
GOATed soundtrack
MID character customisation (cmon man this is cyberpunk world, why do I gotta be normal skinny man/skinny woman?)
MID in some specific gameplay details (eg. stealth is still fun, but could be better)
SOUL CRUSHING axed content. Bruh, monowire hacking, mantis blade wall running, a moonbase etc. would be so cool

Definitely made the right choice if you waited a few years to buy it after the nightmare launch. Shame it didn't stay in full dev for a few years longer and pop out that extra content and polish.",True
1091500,"Incredible story, deep RPG elements, and a world/city that is truly living, breathing, and that takes on a role in the story all its own. Cyberpunk is a phenomenal RPG and a pinnacle of storytelling.",True
1091500,"Probably one of the best games I've played in my life, both DLC and main stories are amazing, every character in this game is very well done and everyone has a different personality that makes the game feel way more diversified and makes you feel connected and emphatize for them, all missions are different and fun, even the secondary ones
despite the problems the game had when it launched, it was really worth it to wait for the patches, I highly recommend it.",True
1091500,"[h3]This game has potential. [/h3]

The launch was not great and considering how long it was in development for, all the delays and excuses, this game was not ready for release. CDPR has, and hopefully at the end of this, will still have a brilliant reputation but I think games are being pushed too far in regards to over-hyping, advertising unrealistic gameplay/teasers and just generally releasing so broken. 
[i] Testers need to reevaluate their targets and remember that not everyone runs a high-spec PC or has the latest console, so all platforms of all kinds should hold tests. [/i]

Now, to the game:

[b][u] Pros [/u][/b]
- Great storyline, voice acting isn't the best.
- Some side-quests are really intriguing and can throw you from happy, to sad or leaving you confused but for good reason.
- Interactivity is okay, but there is enough to do in Night City. 
- Choices are thought-provoking though not overly too sure how they have an ultimate knock-on effect towards the end-game.
- Night City is beautiful and fast travelling doesn't seem needed, I can drive around the city and still be in awe even if I had driven down it so many times before. 
- The game immersion, aside from bugs, is okay, not brilliant but enough with how the story goes.
- Combat is as good as you'd expect although not RDR2 level.

[b][u] Cons [/u][/b]
- Promises of bustling city, but it's minimal people doing the exact same routine unless it involves them in a quest
- Cars randomly spawn upside down on the pavement and disappears or explodes, or cars spawn merged with other cars causing a complete eyesore and tear in immersion
- Character Customisation, we were promised it would be the best but I think I can name quite a few games off the bat that did it better.
- Cybernetics, supposed to be the pinical in Night City, but only offers bare minimum usage. All you need is a legendary weapon and things are just like hot knife through butter. Was expecting much more with Cybernetic...

[b][u] DLC- Phantom Liberty: [/u][/b]
The new golden standard for DLC. I felt like I was in a James Bond movie. The cast of characters are all extraordinary and well acted. During the middle of the dlc I felt like I was in the high stakes poker game from Casino Royale absolutely brilliant quest. Dog Town is the best district in Night City by far and is packed to the brim with new gigs, dungeons with dangerous bosses, new vehicle's and dozens of weapons and hundreds of new clothing items. This dlc easily offer's 30 plus hours of new content, and is a masterpiece!!!!

But its playable, it's a good game... just could have done so much more with the time they had.",True
1091500,"The structure of Cyberpunk 2077 feels quite different from many RPGs I've played, including The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. While most games are designed like a tree, with a central story branching out into various paths, Cyberpunk 2077 resembles more of a sprawling bush. You don’t have to progress very far in the main quest before you encounter a dozen or more side activities, all vying for your attention. What's more, many of these opportunities are just a phone call away. In this futuristic world, quest givers often reach out to you directly, so you don't even need to go looking for them. This changes the usual sense of growth that RPGs offer, as the variety of options opens up quickly before leveling off for much of the game. Still, there’s so much to explore and discover, with plenty of hidden content you need to actively seek out, that I didn’t mind swapping that traditional sense of progression for the abundance of choices offered.",True
1091500,Absolutely brilliant game the creates incredible immersion coupled with a fantastic story-line. Night City and its surrounds all have unique feeling zones. Combat and movement is sharp and expressive. Customising your character to minute detail really makes you feel like you have ownership and an investment in your own story. A+++,True
1091500,"Simply one of the best stories I've ever experienced in a game. I enjoyed every moment of it. The characters inspired real compassion, and the vast, immersive world of Night City was breathtaking—chaotic, lost in perdition, yet unforgettable. What a setting, what a storyline!



",True
1091500,"Greatest game i have EVER played, the story is a absolute masterpiece starting of showing u the world in the end of act 1. Amazing characters so many fun side quests insane lore so much exploration with random small stories u can stumble upon in places u would never expect it off. one of the only games which made me immedeitly want to play the game after finishing it, also being the only game where i didnt want to finish the game because i wanted to do more in the world but then the best part imo the combat: having 3 main directions all being really interesting with one of them having many possible builds in one (sandevistan) ive enjoyed all 3 of them greatly and will be purchasing the dlc soon 11/10 absolute masterpiece",True
1091500,Hated a chunk of it but it does have a good gameplay loop and story.,True
1091500,"As a game that had a terrible start. it has gone from polygon nightmare to beautiful game . i have not seen a comeback like this since No Mans Sky . even on a 1050 the game was decent , on the a 3060 it is both beautiful with great game play . the game offers many styles for all gamers . cyber ninja ? done . full bulk badass with only fists ? done ! stealth gameplay ? 100% !!! create your character and see if you can overcome anything . 9/10
",True
1091500,"Only have 3 hours in and was able to add some mods to make the game a little more immersive (like the computer tablet anywhere... very handy). 

So far I am really enjoying the game and like the exploration side of it, I am still trying to get the feel of it with targeting and driving, but liking the game so far... 

Though I had pre-ordered it before it came out, I am thankful that I waited for several patches before playing, I've not run into any bugs, that that is a PLUS in my book!",True
1091500,"One of the best gaming experiences I've ever lived. Night City consumes you, it makes you care for its people, its past and future, and your place in it. Keanu Reeves is embodying one of the best roles in his career, engaging with him is super fun. The rest of the cast stand their ground too, esp the protagonist/s and the DLC characters are believable to say the least.

You can approach this game as a role playing experience or a guns blazing shooter or a stealthy pacifist or... you get it. You can play the usual first-person shooter or develop complex synergies in your own unique build. You can customize your appearance infinitely, discover crazy rides, play a bunch of unique arcade mini games, discover subplots within subplots and never stop exploring.

This game has been stabilized since its despicable launch and right now looks and plays terrific. I can't imagine a realistic Cyberpunk universe looking better than this. If you own a high end pc, just GO FOR IT if only to witness its gorgeous lighting and reflections. The occasional bug is there but nothing game breaking and in the long run won't matter. Not to mention the development team is still updating the game, adding and fixing stuff 4+ years later and keeping the community active with new lore and photo contests or other gimmicks for hardcore fans.

A huge bonus is that the DLC is one of the best released; a compelling narrative with lots of different options, a higher Character Level Ceiling with a ton of new upgrades in weapons and cyberware and a whole bunch of new sidequests, gigs, vehicles and areas to explore.

Both the main game and the DLC can be replayed over and over and approached in different story-related choices or playstyles and feel refreshing and rewarding like a new experience.

Oh, and the soundtrack is NUTS. The game has been accused of being just a GTA clone with futuristic gear, but in reality its art style and sound design support the game's aesthetic perfectly to set it apart not only from GTA but also from the other genre defining titles like DEUS EX, exploring similar themes with a whole different approach.

There is so much to love here, there will definitely be something for you. Don't forget to grab the free bonus contect while at it (the original soundtrack included).",True
1091500,"Story is incredibly compelling, after patches gameplay is smooth as f(x)=e^x function. Love this masterpiece",True
1091500,Really fun game. Interesting story. Very cool abilities. 9/10,True
1091500,I can't believe i have waited this long to play this game. Amazing characters and story. After finishing the game felt this weird void in me. This was the first time i have actually bonded with the characters and actually felt sadness when i lost some of them. It was magical like the feeling of watching LotR for the first time.,True
1091500,"Cyberpunk 2077 has come a long way since launch, and I have to say—this game is now one of my all-time favorites. CD Projekt Red put in the work, and it really shows. If you love cyberpunk aesthetics, deep stories, and a world that feels alive, this is a must-play.

Night City is insane. The level of detail, the atmosphere, the way the city feels lived-in—it’s everything I wanted from a cyberpunk world. The neon lights, the shady alleyways, the high-tech skyscrapers, and the different districts all have their own unique feel. Walking through the streets, hearing conversations, and watching the chaos unfold around you makes it feel like a real place. It’s easy to get lost just exploring and soaking it all in.

The main story is fantastic, and the choices you make actually matter. Playing as V, trying to navigate the mess of Night City while dealing with Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves absolutely nailed the role) makes for an unforgettable experience. The game doesn’t hold your hand, and it throws a lot of moral dilemmas at you.

But what really makes the game special are the side characters. Panam, Judy, River, Kerry—they all feel like real people with their own problems and dreams. Some of the side quests are just as good, if not better, than the main storyline. The writing is just top-tier, and I found myself really invested in the characters and their stories.

The Phantom Liberty DLC takes everything great about Cyberpunk 2077 and turns it up even more. New missions, new characters (Idris Elba’s character Solomon Reed is my favourite), and new gear make this expansion worth every second. The espionage and action elements add a fresh twist, making it feel like a cyberpunk spy movie. If you already love the game, Phantom Liberty is a no-brainer.

Combat is a blast. Gunplay feels smooth, and melee combat is actually fun now. Hacking is one of my favorite parts—being able to take down enemies by messing with their cyberware or turning their own turrets against them never gets old. You can play this game however you want—sneaky netrunner, melee-focused street samurai, guns-blazing mercenary—it’s all viable, and it’s all fun.

Cyberware adds even more variety. You can install upgrades that let you jump higher, slow down time, or even rip enemies apart with Mantis Blades. The skill tree has been revamped too, making character progression way more rewarding.

Building your version of V is one of the best parts. Whether it’s how your character looks, what weapons you use, or what cyberware you install, there’s a ton of freedom to play how you want. The choices you make feel meaningful, and every build feels unique.

The music in this game is just perfect. Whether you’re walking through the streets, driving through the Badlands, or getting into a firefight, the soundtrack always fits the mood. The voice acting is fantastic across the board, and the ambient sounds of the city make it feel truly alive.

Visually, this game is stunning. With ray tracing and all the graphical updates, Night City looks breathtaking. Performance-wise, it’s night and day compared to launch—smooth, optimized, and finally what it was meant to be. If you’re playing on a decent PC or a next-gen console, you’re in for a visual treat.

Cyberpunk 2077 has gone from a troubled launch to one of the best RPGs I’ve ever played. The story, the world, the characters, the combat—it all comes together beautifully now. CD Projekt Red really turned things around, and if you love sci-fi, cyberpunk settings, or just great storytelling, you owe it to yourself to play this game.",True
1091500,Story rich and it is definitely one of the best open world games i've ever played with great and stunning secondary quests. Side jobs surprisingly do not get repetitive over the time. Also DO NOT forget to play Phantom Liberty DLC.,True
1091500,"Wonderful story telling with some optimization problems. Lots of endings and routes to take with loads of lovable characters. Great involvement of grey areas within the character and the player, forcing realistic ends carved with careful decision making.",True

1091500,"Dystopian tragedy done perfectly. Absolute masterpiece that is a MUST play. One of the most immersive fictional worlds I have gotten to experience. Amazing story AND an 11/10 DLC that is arguably better than the base game. Lovable characters and sad stories, it's got it all.  Please do yourself a favour and play this title if you enjoy well made passionate work. I am glad I waited till recently to play the game to enjoy it to the fullest since most bugs and issues got fixed; now is a better time than ever to hop in and enjoy. CDPR...bravo",True

Apesar da CD Projekt ter decepcionado na pré-venda, acredito que hoje eles conseguiram deixar o jogo redondinho. Para mim, tornou-se um dos melhores jogos que já joguei. Me fez refletir, me diverti com inúmeras interações com personagens bem construídos, e a narrativa é simplesmente de tirar o fôlego, com reviravoltas incríveis e de muito bom gosto.

Além disso, como apaixonado por arte, fiquei impressionado com o quanto esse jogo entrega nesse aspecto.

O único ponto fraco, na minha opinião, é o balanceamento dos inimigos. Joguei no hard e senti que eles são muito fracos, enquanto os chefes da campanha são absurdamente mais fortes que os Cyberpsicopatas. No entanto, sei que existem mods que ajudam a equilibrar esse aspecto.

Peguei ele na promoção por 79,00R$ e pra mim valeu, fiz 2 finais diferentes e ainda tem muita coisa para explorar e me divertir.",True
1091500," this game quickly climbed into my TOP 5 games of all time. 
Cyberpunk is the most visually immersive and one of the most detailed games I have ever played, the graphics with PT and music are fantastic and the world building is something else.

It's not just simple futuristic aesthetics. I can feel the unique culture from within Night City, the different groups/gangs, the way people act, the slang they use, it all brings so much life to the world of Cyberpunk

the game bugs have significantly decreased and  story is just great, along with the amazing side missions and quests and gigs and and and... and don't let me get started on the Phantom Liberty expansion, LEVELS. The characters are really great as well, so many personalities to form connections with and plus, who doesn't want to play a game along side Keanu Reeves? Not to mention Idris Elba.

Really love the weapons and different play styles this game offers, from heavy assault with the baddest guns in town, to full on melee with your sharpest katana paired with your netrunning/hacking skills, or even take a stealth approach, the choice is yours.

Character customisation is just a delight and I enjoyed creating my different people.

Sickness all around, I have so much more to say, but this was it for now. 100% Recommend. I am glad to have joined this journey and I look forward to what comes next.",True
1091500,One of the best games ever! I've loved it before the big update and I love it even more now :D,True
1091500,"played this game when it first came out and it was so hard to get into with all the bugs, but this game is actually incredible and amazing now. CD Projekt Red really earned every bit of respect they could ever need from me for fixing this and making it everything we all wanted when it first came out.",True
1091500,"I played this game on launch on the PS4 and 100% the game then, and despite how bad that was I still thoroughly enjoyed the story and the atmosphere. Nowadays after rework and patch this game is fantastic story, music, atmosphere everything you could ever want out of a single player open world RPG. The mods after you have played vanilla bleeds life right back into it.",True
1091500,"Choooom, One of the best solo campaigns out there. Expansive maps, immersive stories, impressive range of side jobs, gigs and additional quests. Top 3 games of all time for me.",True
1091500,"Cyberpunk 2077 is like a dystopian fever dream where you play as a mercenary named V, who’s basically a walking IKEA catalog of cyberware and poor life choices. The game is set in Night City, a place so grim it makes Blade Runner look like a Disney vacation. It’s a world where corporations rule, everyone has a tragic backstory, and your best friend is a gun that occasionally talks to you.

The story is a rollercoaster of emotions—mostly despair, with a side of existential dread. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, and you’ll question why you thought stealing a priceless relic from a megacorp was a good idea. Johnny Silverhand (played by Keanu Reeves, who’s basically playing himself but angrier) is your digital ghost roommate, and he’s either the best or worst part of the game, depending on how much you enjoy being called a ""gonk"" every five minutes.

Pros:

Night City is stunning when it’s not glitching into the void.

The soundtrack slaps harder than a cyberpsycho on a rampage.

Judy Alvarez exists. That’s it. That’s the pro.

Cons:

Bugs. So many bugs. I once saw a car phase through a building and honestly, it felt lore-accurate.

The AI is about as smart as a toaster. Cops will literally spawn behind you, yell ""STOP RIGHT THERE,"" and then forget you exist.

You’ll spend more time customizing your character than actually seeing them (thanks, first-person view).

In conclusion, Cyberpunk 2077 is a mess, but it’s our mess. It’s like dating someone toxic but hot—you know it’s bad for you, but you can’t look away. 7/10, would get cyberpsychosis again.",True
1091500,"I don't think I've been more absorbed within the storytelling of a video game before. I've laughed, and cried while connecting with the diverse roster of characters, the immersion is surreal. Feeling these types of emotions from a video game plants themselves deep into your heart. Everything just hits the right places nice and deep, Phantom Liberty adds onto that making this easily one of the best video games of all time.

Cyberpunk 2077 is truly an unforgettable experience.

[i] My playtime is on console, don't mind the 8hrs here. [/i]",True
1091500,"10/10 The most alive i've felt playing a game since the original release of Skyrim. I know they messed this game up on release, but it is now a legend status masterpiece.",True
1091500,"The game is absolutely awesome! I have not been this hooked up to a video game for long time. I cant believe I held up so long to get it because of how this game was review bombed. It must have been over 2 years in my wishlist. Only shows how fans can be unfair sometimes.

Let's Start with Cons:
- Occasional bug and crash to desktop (happened maybe 2-3 times that the game flatlined). You can sometimes encounter wrecks of cars on the road which are not actual obstacles and cannot be interacted with, you can just drive through them like they were not there. From time to time you will see a flying object, levitating NPC or a car in really strange position.
- AI is superb dumb - police is the dumbest - even if you have 5 stars at being wanted they will forget about you in a minute or two if they cant see you. Even if you are just around a pillar and can see 5 policemen looking for you and slowly approaching your position then all of a sudden timer beeps, the stars start to flash for a few seconds and bang you are not wanted anymore. You go out of the pillar and policemen do not recognise you anymore even tho you just butchered a few dozens (or hundreds?) of their colleagues. I wish this could be addressed as it breaks immersion and is just straight out idiotic. Or when you enter the mission they stop chasing you. Not only police is stupid, all the enemies if they lose sight of you for a minute or something they lose interest or just stand there waiting to be smoked.
- You get too OP. I get that you are supposed to be a Night City Legend but the highest difficulty level should  be more challenging especially a little bit later when you get more cyberware and good weapons. For now game is only challenging on higher difficulties for the first few hours. Maybe until level 10 or 15. From level 40 you barely die and can just storm through 20 or 30 opponents. Only very occasionally you will die. 
- No flying machines that can be interacted with of piloted is a little disappointing in futuristic game like this. There should be flying cars or helicopters that could be piloted.

Pros:
- Story is amazing
- Most of the side quests are great and engaging. Even the repetitive quests like kill or steal are great because every time they are in different setting building etc and the gunplay never gets boring
- Gunplay is just great. Feels right maybe except for technical weapons which are not very fun. Also Melee weapons seems to be under-powered to compare them to shotgun for example
- NPCS are amazing so many memorable characters. 
- Voice acting is spot on
- Choices are good however there should be more 
- Romance option is thre and it is exciting
- Graphics is top notch
- Cars and driving feels great. Every car can be driven from 1st person perspective and every car has unique design with wheel radio and all interiors. How amazing is that?
- V - the protagonist is a cool interesting guy you can chose your starting position too
- Johnny Silverhand played by Keanu Reeves. How cool is this!
- Beautiful and alive city with so many people in and cars. So many unique districts 
- A lot of places where you can fight with lowlives just for fun without needing any quest
- Such a great music and variety. So many different radio stations
- You get a mobile phone! And can call or text other NPC! Cool
- Leveling system is good and rewarding.
- Quests are plentiful
- Almost no copy and paste buildings, cellars or locations. Everything feels unique

So much love was put into this game it is amazing. For me 9/10 - I dont mind an occasional bug but if they worked on poor AI and AI realism then it would be strong 9.5/10 for me. If they added extreme difficulty level with more challenge it would have been 10/10
",True
1091500,"This is the first pc game I've played in over 23 years.  I have to say that I'm not disappointed at all!  I'm loving this game!  The graphics are amazing, the game play is a lot of fun too!  Has kind of a GTA vibe with much better story telling and way better character development.  I'm having a blast!",True
1091500,"I honestly didn't bother playing this due to the insane number of reports stating the many game breaking issues and glitches it had since launch; I heard recently that the game was now stable enough to play, and actually managed to get an ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" review status on steam which is impressive considering how low it had dipped due to it basically being a game bug simulator.

I've enjoyed almost everything about playing cyberpunk, the DLC was a crazy good story on it's own... I've had more then enough side missions and places to explore and I'm heading toward endgame with around 70+ hours of gameplay on my save file.  I'd highly recommend people giving this a chance now, since I've not been disappointed and it's easily became one of my most favourite games to just chill and play.",True
1091500,"Cyberpunk 2077 is a straight-up MASTERPIECE now.

My first playthrough was rushed—I missed so much of the incredible story and side quests. But after the 2.0 update? Mind. Blown. My second run was perfection. I fell in love with every bit of lore, the freedom to strategize my build (no “right way” to play!), and the characters who feel like real people.

I got so attached that I played through every ending—each one hit hard, especially with that god-tier soundtrack amplifying the emotions. Night City’s story, the bitter-sweet moments, the music… it all left a permanent mark on me.

CDPR 100% did this game justice. If you’re on the fence, dive in. It’s an unforgettable experience.",True
1091500,"Honestly rocking a ryzen 2600 and RX 590, the game: runs great, looks great, and is just a great solo game now. IK people said it was terrible when it released. now, its great even on my old ass pc. trying to 100% a run and then achievement hunt it and i usually dont do that. dont have the DLC and dont know much about it (like my knowledge of cyberpunk before i bought it, none) but might buy it if its on discount sale.",True

1091500,"I've always liked this game, even with the extremely buggy launch. The world building is so incredible you rarely see something this well crafted. There are parts of the city that look so lived it I can imagine what it would be like to live there. Story sucks major ass though and I ended up taking the secret ending and not playing for several years.",True
1091500,"Played this game on OG PS4 with all the bugs and wonky mechanics. I still had fun playing then and now its just amazing. To see this game go from a wonky mess to being a benchmark to test the highest of high end PCs is something that nobody expected. The atmosphere, the characters, music, and gameplay all slap. Cyberpunk is right up there with Witcher and has a ton of potential cant wait to see what is coming next!",True
1091500,"Do yourself a favor, play this game.

Since I've installed a hundred of (FREE) mods ranging from gameplay, movements, mostly visual fixs and upgrades, this game is stunnnnnnning. Thank you my beloved 4090, heating my place the whole winter!",True
1091500,"I Bought Cyberpunk when the game first came out, and I knew it wasn't for me.
As time has gone on, I have felt less and less of a draw towards story games like Cyberpunk, and was turned off by the glitches, and missteps by the dev team with the rushed release.
5 years later, at the recommendation of a friend, I forced myself to attempt my third play through of the game.
I regret waiting all this time to play it. There are so many quality of life improvements, and fine tuning, that the game is unrecognisable. 
The game play is fun and addicting, no matter how you play it, and the story and characters blew me away. 
This game has a lot to teach you, and leaves you with a lot to reflect on.",True
1091500,"Cyberpunk 2077 Took me multiple tries and probably 15 full hours to get into - but once I was into it, wow. This game has everything you could want from an open world RPG and it is simply stunning to look at on top of everything else.",True

We had to pay the price
Yeah we lost everything
We had to pay the price

I saw in you what life was missing
You lit a flame that consumed my hate

I'd trade it all for your sweet embrace

Yeah
'Cause we lost everything
We had to pay the price

There's a canvas with two faces
Of fallen angels who loved and lost
It was a passion for the ages
And in the end guess we paid the cost

A thing of beauty, I know

What you did to me, I know
Said what you had to say

Will never fade away

That one sin that caused the fall

1091500,"I didn't have many expectations when I initially bought it but the multiple patches over the years turned a huge mess of a game into something so special that I ended up sinking 100h+ of playtime and finishing all the achievements in no time.

Totally understand people's skepticism about whether or not it's worth giving it a try since I come from the same place as them but as of right now I can safely say the amount of gameplay, variety of things to do and overall quality it's definitely worth checking out.
Considering main game and dlc took me together roughly 130h to finish, I'd argue it's worth buying even outside of discounts since we now live in a times where AAA titles barely make it past 40/50h of total playtime and ask for twice as much in total price.",True
1091500,"Played the game for the first time winter 2024 after my friend recommended it and fell in love immediately! 
Though I originally wasn't sure about it (me normally not being a fan of futuristic settings), I was obsessed and it actually helped me through a very rough time in life.

The Story is amazing, the NPCs have so much personality and are unique and you just have to love them! I cared deeply for the side-quests. Even though I normally get burned out rather fast in other games when it comes to optional content, I simply had to help these people. No burnout in sight!

And the Gameplay is a blast as well! Nothing better than zooming across the map and slicing baddies up, feeling like a god~ 
You can customize your version of V however you want, being able to change your mind almost at any point! And due to that, the replayability is also very great in my opinion 

A must try for anyone who likes well written characters, a (intentionally) messy and beautiful world and a game to completely lose yourself in <3",True
1091500,"The game is great, it's hard to find any bugs from the release, in 4 years the developers made the game from rags to riches.
The game shows what life would look like if corporations took over the world.",True
1091500,"Hands down one of the best modern RPGs. If you're even thinking of getting it just do it. 
I would highly recommend getting it with the Phantom Liberty DLC as (imo) it greatly enhances the base game with a unique area, awesome items and mini bosses and a gripping and devastating story . 
It's cliche to say that CDPR have redeemed themselves from the godawful launch but its true, this game is a phenomenal technical and literary triumph. My 160hrs breezed by with still more I could've done.
I also had the joy of playing this entirely on my Steam Deck where it definitely did not look as good as it could've on a PC it was still really beautiful (if you're willing to play with settings). The performance still suffers noticeably often. Mostly in Dogtown and in other highly dense areas. Saying this, with my settings I regularly got a stable 60fps. Loading could sometimes take a few minutes. However, all these trade-offs did not put me off the game at all for the sheer fact that I could play Cyberpunk 2077 on the train/bus/work/couch. If you have a steam deck it is an (ugly) joy.",True
1091500,"Cyberpunk 2077 is an amazing game that fully delivers on its promise of an immersive, futuristic RPG experience. From its stunning open world to its engaging gameplay and memorable characters, everything comes together in a way that makes it one of the best games I’ve played.

World & Atmosphere – Night City is Incredible
The world is absolutely breathtaking. Night City feels alive, with insane attention to detail, neon-lit streets, and a dark, dystopian atmosphere that pulls you in completely. Exploring the world is pure joy, whether you’re driving through the city or sneaking through high-tech buildings.

Story & Characters – A Strong Narrative
The main story is fantastic, with plenty of twists, emotional moments, and tough decisions. V is a great protagonist, and their story is engaging from start to finish. Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves) adds a unique dynamic, and his interactions with V are a highlight of the game.

The side characters are well-written, with standout moments from Panam, Judy, River, and Rogue. Side quests don’t feel like filler—they add depth to the world and its inhabitants, making every interaction feel meaningful.

Gameplay – Fun and Engaging
The combat is excellent—gunplay feels great, hacking adds depth, and cyberware upgrades allow for tons of customization. Whether you prefer stealth, brute force, or a mix of both, the game lets you approach missions however you want.

Driving feels smooth, and exploring Night City never gets old. The RPG mechanics are well-done, with a good balance of progression, skill upgrades, and gear customization.

Final Thoughts – A Must-Play
Despite its rough launch, Cyberpunk 2077 has been polished into an excellent RPG. The world, story, and gameplay all come together to make an immersive and unforgettable experience. If you love open-world games with deep storytelling and exciting gameplay, this is definitely worth playing.

A fantastic game, and one I highly recommend!",True
1091500,"didnt really believe all the hype behind this game and was thinking about putting it down during the 8 hour tutorial. 
but holy shit am i happy i didnt, this game is a masterpiece a roller coaster of emotions and ontop of that its beautiful so many things to do. so many things to experience basically a whole new world to live in 
basically just beautiful left me on the edge of my seat and made me feel things no other games have",True

1091500,"I'm a fan of emotional games. Oh, how bad I felt in 2020 when I chose the ending where I help Hanako. It's surprising that, even though antidepressants dull my emotional experiences, I still feel that sorrow when V dies, and Viktor talks to him with a caring voice. The game has changed drastically over the past four years — I would call it the game of the decade.",True
1091500,"Makes me feel that perfect sense of nostalgia for a thing I've never experienced. Has a story that takes as many playthroughs as you want for it all to really makes sense, with more meaning being understood and appreciated every single time. My offline hours nearly double my visible ones, this game forces you to witness and understand terrible dread and horror, and honestly you'll say thank you.",True
1091500,"Cyberpunk 2077 can be described the same way as Night City itself: glamorous and rotten to the core.

The city is detailed and gorgeous, but it's empty, acting only as a set dressing for missions. The missions themselves have strong moments, but the writing is sometimes atrocious. There are a lot of choices, but most of the time the world just does its thing (seriously, the game kept throwing Panam's crotch into my face no matter how much I tried to keep our relationship professional). There are interesting upgrades in the skill tree and cool weapons and tools to use, but after a short while, you become so powerful it doesn't matter what you use. Updates have fixed the worst technical issues, so now it's only as buggy as you would expect from other open world games.

There are more issues but I'm too lazy to write them down. I hope you get the idea. I was about to click the thumb down.

Then I went through the ""point of no return"" and after that took some time to think back on the journey.

I'll be honest. I really enjoyed the payoff. And looking back, I very much appreciate the attempt to improve on the burning pile that are open world games. Time will tell how I'll remember this game. Is it worth being annoyed for 60 hours before a grand finale and an occasion to look at the state of AAA games? Your mileage may vary. 

Considering the games I enjoy, I would be a hypocrite if I gave this game a thumb down.

Cyberpunk 2077 is awful. And it's one of the best open world games I ever played.",True

1091500,"Highly recommend, great story line, multiple endings, relationships and more. I really wish there was more tbh. I played this on ps5 and wanted to see how it ran on my PC so I bought it again. The graphics are amazing. There are multiple endings and your choices affect the outcome. Not for kids, so parents be warned there if full on nudity in the game. 
 Wish I could find more games like this. Cannot get enough of this game.",True
1091500,"I really wanted to like this game, but I guess it's just not for me. The character customization is much better than any other game I've played, so I'll give it that. But the story was hard to get invested in, the gameplay is just okay enough to be entertaining but not as in depth as I'd like for the genre, it's way too easy to become OP and stops being challenging around the 2/5 mark even if you set it to a higher difficulty... Realistically, I'd give it a 6 out of 10. I hope anyone else that tries it likes it more than I did, and you likely will; This game's gotta be marked overwhelmingly positive for a reason.",True

The story? Phenomenal. The characters? Unforgettable. From the moment you step into V’s shoes, you’re hooked. The voice acting, the emotional depth, and the sheer freedom of choice make every playthrough unique. And with Phantom Liberty, the game reaches a whole new level of intensity.

The combat is slick, the hacking mechanics are top-tier, and the world-building is unmatched. Whether you're a stealthy netrunner or a guns-blazing cyber-warrior, there’s something for every playstyle.

Personally for me I think that the game is really good but it some cool feature like BD i really wish that i could watch it without adding mod or doing mission or side quests. But overall i give it like a 9.2/10 it could have been a 10 out of 10 but like i said it lack some feature. (hope this review help),True
1091500,"Excellent game! I had a difficult time getting into it at first, but everything changed once I finished Act 1 and was allowed to wander off into NC unsupervised. IMO, it is best with a Keyboard and mouse, but keep a controller nearby because driving with Kb&M is... lacking. 
Combat is fluid and fun. Cyber enhancements make the game novel, but can lead to being overpowered quickly if you put points in the right places. 
As I mentioned before, Act 1 was slow for me, but once the characters and setting are established the story becomes really enjoyable and compelling. I found myself choosing the story over random quests despite my penchant for playing most open world games like a easily distracted dog chasing butterflies.
Overall, this is an excellent game and is worth more than the $25 sale price. If it had been this polished at launch I would say it was worth the launch price tag.",True

One of the best game I've ever played. Too bad the launch was spoiled by technical difficulties. But it offers late comers the chance to discover this incredible game. Played on steamdeck without issues. Oh, and the DLC is even better!",True
1091500,This game is really fun especially for people that like story games,True
1091500,love the game but i have no clue if its good vanila since im runnig a modpack but still a great game also let this review be a testement to why pirating is good,True
1091500,"Wow! I'm so impressed with how this game started out as a giant failure and was diligently turned into a fantastic game. The dedication behind it is undeniable. It has its flaws and all, but I'm enjoying this so much.

Thanks for all the work! Would recommend.",True
1091500,Great graphics and a good story mode so far (i'm on my first play through),True

1091500,"Cyberpunk 2077 is a breathtaking open-world RPG that has truly evolved into something special. The world of Night City is alive with incredible detail, vibrant characters, and a story that keeps you hooked from start to finish. The immersive gameplay, deep character customization, and thrilling combat make it a blast to play. The updates and improvements over time have really elevated the experience, and the narrative is one of the best in modern RPGs. If you love futuristic, story-driven games with rich exploration and action, Cyberpunk 2077 is a must-play!",True
1091500,"have a decent rig to run with good quality, the game play is great sometimes the dialogue can be drawn out like a monologue. Great graphics and great features to a first person shooter.",True
1091500,"Been here since this was a bug infested tragedy of a game, watched as it developed over the years (I know it says I only have 14 hours on here, most of my time is on Xbox). It's really awesome to see that Cyberpunk Edgerunners got integrated with the game with hidden Easter Eggs and in game weapons and cosmetics. This game was a nightmare to play just a few years ago, but now I believe it's blown far past expectations, especially with mods (But I'm not going through that rabbit hole of dependency mods)


TL;DR: Good game, better than before *SpongeBob Caveman sound*",True
1091500,"Masterfully recovered experience from CD Projekt Red. Gives a simple, yet morally deep plot taking place in the morally bankrupt, corporate-ruled Night City, wherein you play as a self insert, starting from nothing. As you progress, you go from powerless, with combat being life-or-death scenarios, to a tank, power housing your way through combat engagements in seconds. Beautifully done, and fun to play.",True
1091500,One of the best games I've ever played. Even without Phantom Liberty still a very fun game to play and the story is amazing.,True
1091500,"One of the best Open World storytelling games on the market. The story and characters are rock solid, with plenty of high and low emotional moments coupled with those nail biting stressful encounters night city offers. The writing makes most of this possible, especially in the Phantom Liberty DLC. But the world feels real, lived in, and has nearly an endless amount of lore for you to dive into. While giving you more than enough freedom with your character builds and weapon choices, the cyberware and hacking also being a very welcome and unique edition to the game's combat system. The visuals and environments are also top tier, with neon lit cityscape galore, to derelict slums and industrial parks.

I've played through the game 2X on console and now have a beefy computer to see all the eye candy at max to play for my 3rd time, and definitely one of the best looking games of all time.  CD Project Red has cleaned up a mess of a launch they had originally with this game, to make it one of the best of all time!  So much to explore, and so many ways to play.  One of the few games that I've played more than once or even twice now.",True
1091500,Great game! DLC and maintenance significantly improved the game from day one. Would highly recommend.,True
1091500,"Not usually a fan of most open world games, as I feel they lack mechanical depth, which is usually my favorite aspect in most games. However, this is a game you CAN'T dislike (barring launch obviously, I made the wise decision of buying it on sale after all the main patches had released)

The main story still feels kinda rushed, but phantom liberty is an absolute masterclass of storytelling, world-building, and atmosphere, through and through. If you're even considering getting this game, wait for a sale and get the ultimate edition, you won't regret it.

As for actual criticims, the biggest gripe I have with the game is its missed potential. Even after the patches, anyone who's played the game once (even without keeping up with its development cycle) can tell it was meant for a lot more. The map can feel flat in some places despite being the most gorgeous open world I've seen in a video game, the latter half of the story has the vibe of ""OK let's get this shit over with already"", and any semblance of balance is immediately annihilated the second you discover [spoiler] Sandevistan + Any fucking sword that has stats directly correlating to Sandevistan [/spoiler], BUT this is an RPG, OP builds are expected and the game still offers a wide range of options that are more than viable.

I'd rather address what I didn't like as it is much less than what I did like. And outside of what I discussed? The game's a must play, ESPECIALLY if you have a higher end GPU and want to crank that shit to overdrive",True
1091500,"One of the best games I've played. I bought it on PS when it first came out and I never understood the bad reviews. I decided to purchase this again while it was on sale with Phantom Liberty and it's just as good, if not better than I remember it to be.

1091500,"I knew going in I would at least enjoy the aesthetic of this game being a huge fan of everything this game is based off of. But instead I got a story that made me think hard about the choices I had to make and how it would affect the relations of those around me. I grew to love most of the characters and got to fully enjoy their arcs. Not since Fallout: New Vegas has an RPG of this caliber really pulled me in and not let me go. I'm currently writing this after finishing my 1st play through and I already have plans for the next (after a hiatus to digest everything this game threw at me)

Beautiful game, amazing story lines, funny sidequests and great combat and customization. Not to mention, the DLC is excellent! 11/10",True
1091500,"I've never been so obsessed to such a dystopian world-building game up to a point where I have bought both the game and DLC on Xbox and PS5. It has so much replay-ability that without mods I have placed +200 hours on both my consoles combined. 

And now with Mods, its total chaos. If you watched Edge Runners and hesitant to buy the game due to the initial response release, Don't worry. Its far from that and no one will disagree that this game has truly done a 180. This game for sure has sparked my deep interest into dystopian genre and I appreciate it for that. 

This game is one of those games that everyone must give a try at least through one run.

1091500,"Game is good after all, but endings leaves a different opinion, mosty due community ""correct"" opinion

!Ending spoilers!

[spoiler] With DLC there are 5 endings, and by the community opinion (because game directly says, and it is DLC one) where V have a normal (probably the only one ending where V will have a long live), althought in few others V survives but only for 6 months. In my opinion, it is kinda bs, because V survives in 3/5 endings, because V dies if Johnny takes his/her body ending, and ending where you take help from corpo (because you have option to live 6 months or accept deal of selling your soul to corpo) [/spoiler]


[spoiler] So, IMO, V survives and have long live in every other ending because V gets rid of the Johhny relic, so it stops damaging V`s brains. Because 6 months are given ONLY if you accept corpo path due removing relic. And the worst ending of having long live is in DLC ending, due problems with artifical brain. But in every ending where Alt helps V, and Johhny leaves V alone, she/he survives. [/spoiler]

I remember all the bad things people had to say about Cyberpunk when it first came out, specifically how rough the PS4 release version was. I almost didn't give it chance because of all the bad things I heard, and I'm happy to say that CD Projekt Red has surpassed my expectations and more. This game has me hook, line, and sinker. The story drove me to tears once I reached the end, it was genuinely emotionally devastating (I still haven't recovered). The city feels so alive, the characters are likeable and have so much depth to them, the combat is the most fun I've had in an open world game before, and there's so much content that it's not even possible to do everything in one play-through. This is one of my biggest game recommendations. If you ever had doubts, give it a chance.",True
1091500,"It's the kind of game you need when you need immersion. 
An escape. For me, it was exactly what I needed. 
Played the vanilla loved it. Now playing the tweaked version/Bladerunner *guilty* mods and all few years on.
It's a fantastic game. Made with love.
I'm glad CDPR toughed through it.
It can be very overwhelming at the start. But not too much that you give up.
Lot of thought put into the mechanics and it shows.
Great effects.
Great audio
Story starts fun turns great at the end. Maybe too on the nose?...
The Vanilla is great:
It's worth it.

8/10 Pineapples.




",True
1091500,"I really enjoyed the game, the fact that the devs still cared and continued fixing the game is really nice.
The combat is really awesome and fun, when the edgerunner perk kicks in you feel invincible! The sandevistan its at another level. The katanas and Fist are really fun, and the stealth too, there are a lot of ways of doing the same mission and that gives you a really nice feeling.

There are a few details that I would love to change about somethings and mechanic tho:

Non lethal does not make any difference in almost all of the main story and sidequests and its quite sad, it makes it pointless. also, when you put K.O. an npc, it doesnt recover or wake up, making it hard to know if they are alive or just unconscious 
Some missions doesn´t have alternatives like with Evelyn that she well, yk. And even thought you can complete sidequest in different ways, in the
Theres a point in the story where I personally felt like the devs just said something like ¨mmm lets go straight to the end¨, after you talk with hanako it feels rushed.

The cyberware capacity system is really weird because at some point in the game the shards just doesn't appear, I know it would be broken to make it more easy to get but, take note that a lot of players use a mod for the cyberwareshards! It needs a fix.

personally, I REALLY REALLY enjoyed the game, I wish it was longer or well, I hope we get more of the game in the future, like with phantom liberty",True
1091500,"An incredible game. It's darker than I usually like but I'm glad I gave it a chance. There are still occasional crashes for me and you'll need a good GPU. You'll be drawn in. Night City feels alive and looks beautiful, even when it's ugly on purpose.",True
1091500,"Enjoyed the game overall. Beautiful expansive world but almost seems too big sometimes. I hate missing out on stuff but feel the need to fast travel so much to get things done - just don't have the time to stop and take it all in. The story and cut scenes were great with memorable characters you care about. The UI felt crowded and the crafting and modding didn't hit well for me, seemed a little bit of an after thought. I played on normal difficulty and it was never a challenge, could of stood for a bit more creativity in the fights, especially boss battles.",True
1091500,"This game is so much fun so far , the graphics are insane , the storyline 5 hours in so far is about a 8/10 if im being honest , and the different implants im planning to get in my body is lowkey crazy like im trying to get a sandevistan which will take me a bit but overall this game is awesome!",True
1091500,"This is an excellent AAA game. If you have avoided it because of the rocky launch do yourself a favor and buy this and the expansion now. You are going to love it. I personally think the most fun is to sneak around and complete missions without being seen or killing anyone. Great stealth mechanics and the quests often reward you with extras for playing that way. One last thing, Panam 4 life <3!",True
1091500,I was very hyped to play this game really after playing Witcher 3. However I didn't have a pc to play it so now is the time I play it for the first time. I heard there were so much bugs and glitches in the game at the release. But there is nothing like that now. Game is very good. Enjoyable. Really like the vibe and stories of the Night City.,True
1091500,"Hard to give a review without spoiling anything...

It's basically a combination of GTA5 + Metal Gear Solid (the older one from PS2). What is unique to this game is the environment/city. It's incredibly well designed and full of details. Very impressive environment, can't stress this enough.

Lots of ways to develop your character, almost difficult to understand at times. It's definitely complicated and while it can be neat, it's almost too much. Also you can't max out every stat, so you should focus on certain things you want. My character ended up being good at everything and I may want to do it again to see if the game play is different.


Tons of weapons and fighting styles.

Story line and characters are really good for a game. I highly recommend buying both the main game and DLC Phantom Liberty if it's on sale. The DLC alone is substantial content-wise.

Kinda wished there wasn't so much emphasis on the clothing and customization since your character is 1st person anyways, rarely do you see yourself.

I'm running this with a RTX 4070ti Super and it looks great. Getting great frames with 5700x CPU. There are some times where the game crashes, usually during super fast paced engagements like driving cars fast through the streets.

If you like GTA, Red Dead Redemption, and old metal gear games you should really like this.",True

1091500,"Night City is stunning, the characters are deep and the story hits hard. Side quests are top tier sometimes even better than the main plot of many other games. The atmosphere pulls you in and the world feels alive.
Yeah there are some minor bugs but nothing deal breaking. If you love RPGs this one is a must play.",True

CB2077 has great game mechanics, is story rich, AMAZING visuals that sucks you in.
For those that are wondering they HAVE fixed all the bugs and glitches that people reported on launch but if your game is ''flat-lining'' there will be a fix on YT it sometimes has to do with outdated mods and you have to view the integrity of your files which again is online.
I highly recommend getting the game with phantom liberty. 
10/10 game.",True
1091500,"After the 2.0 update(s) and the additional DLC, Cyberpunk 2077 is one of my favorite games of all time (within my top 5). It had a rough start, but with Cyberpunk Edgerunners reviving the community, and CD Projeckt Red continuing to support the game, it made a fantastic comeback.

It's not very often that a game leads me into other forms of media. I've looked into additional books, comics, articles, etc. just to get a bit more of the world that was created. That is the power of what can happen if you make a great game, and I look forward to the next installment.",True
1091500,"The greatest comeback a story game has ever made !! Can't wait for more CD PROJECT RED games.

Of course, there are guns, but there's so much more. Multiple rich storylines, many characters to follow throughout their journey, especially as they stand by your side throughout yours. A ton of fun, engaging mechanics, with a satisfying sense of progression. Given that I'm saying this four and a bit years after release, this is probably obvious by now, but man. Banger game.",True
1091500,Its a fun game that has amazing graphics if you have the GPU to handle it.,True
1091500,"I recommend this because it's the only half decent scifi ""Skyrim"" game available.  And no, Starfield doesn't rate even to this level.  So, pros are straightforward - it's Skyrim but cyberpunk.  Now for the cons.

TONS of bugs even years later.  Mission to stealth kill a boss.  I get to the room, choose dialog option, it leads to combat.  Reload a save from outside the room and now the game refuses to offer the dialog option even though I was clean up to the save.  I distract the boss via a terminal, he walks over to it back to me.  I enter the room and he instantly rubber bands back to his original location - just flies backwards 20 feet - and then alerts and I fail the stealth part.

Even when the game works ""normally"" stealth playstyle is totally fucked.  People just randomly turn on a dime and it forces a save and play approach which kills the fun.

Very Hard mode makes most builds and playstyles completely untenable.  Actually here, you're best bet is stealth takedowns from behind with HEAVY use of savescumming.  Not fun.

But if you like the idea of a stealth playstyle, maybe you'll focus on snipers.  Guess what, the only one you can run stealth is underpowered and won't kill anything above normal in one shot.  So you'll actually do better ""sniping"" at long range with a silenced pistol than a sniper rifle.  Ludicrous.

If you try to stealth attack with a katana you'll just injure them and alert everyone.  But with your bare hands you instakill.  Again, totally absurd.

Tons of poor interface issues.  Like even on keyboard a lot of things bind to the same thing.  So you'll finish a Police Scanner encounter and you have to wait like 15 seconds for the text of a journal drop to be available via  a pop up.  You need to wait, and trigger it then, or it's a PITA to go through the Journal interface.  But then you got XP at the same time and that triggers your fixer calling you with some shit, which interferes.  Or you want to pick an item up but no matter where you hover the mouse you can't get it - but you can pick up this other thing 5 feet to the left.  Or the radio in your apartment and car that randomly reset every time you leave - as if some asshole keeps breaking into your apartment and turning it back on.  There's a drop attack you can do, but if you don't land it ""right"" it'll screw up and then everyone is alerted so it's pretty unusable.  You can use throwing knives but only one.  Then it magically reappears like you're the God of War.  If you have more knives you can't use those - you have to wait for ""magic knife"".

Like most recent games it has a hamfisted ""woke"" storyline shoved in in the form of a trans revenge murder side quest.  Still didn't spare CDPR from woke backlash anyway, but given their recent C-suite exec wide eye stare youtube preaching fealty it's only going to get worse in their future games.  At least it's not as bad as FC6 where someone gets murdered for the crime of misgendering.

All of the endings are total ass.  I get that it's a dystopian future but they really screw over the protagonist and, by extension, the friends that you choose to ultimately die for you, die for nothing.  Unless you read the spoilers to unlock the secret solo ending and even then you get a shit ending.  Or use the Phantom Liberty new ending option and.. yeah that's still super shitty but at least you don't get your friends killed.

The newly added sandevistan builds are cool but then you can't disable cameras with the deck which makes the soft requirement to stealth half the quests impossible.  So it's an end game build option and there is no end game.

Save all the cyberpsychos until late game with a cloak equipped.  Save the beat on the brats for end game and get gorilla arms.  Both of these get offered to you right at the start and just aren't set up for that.",True
1091500,I rate this game 2nd place story and gameplaywise for me in that depratment nothing can beat the Red Dead games. But huge props to the Devs for making this masterpiece and bringing us one of best animes of all time.,True
1091500,"Honestly, the first game in a long time that makes me want to replay it over and over again. It not being repetitive and unpredictable is what makes this game fun for me. There will always be cons in games and without being bias I think with that being said the cons that the game has now, are not as game breaking as they used to be. 

Overall, I do recommend this to other players who are looking for something more free and immersive. The story is jam packed and compelling. Game is very much enjoyable.",True
1091500,"amazing graphics, great gameplay",True
1091500,"I bought this game when the Ultimate Edition was released but I only began to play it in earnest as of version 2.21 in 2025.  I, like everyone else, had heard the negative things about it at launch.  I can safely say none of that applies, now.  This is a fun game.  Even as someone who doesn't play first-person games and rarely enjoys shooters, I find the story, characters, and overall atmosphere of this game to be engaging.  I highly recommend, and bonus if you are a fan of the cyberpunk genre, because the game definitely delivers the vibe.",True
1091500,one of the games where I actually just picked the closest quest and just started completing everything. Not a big fan of story mode style games but this one was pretty good. 100% would recommend. I've done two alternate endings and will probably do a few more.,True
1091500,"best game i've ever played, incredible graphics, great story, fun gunplay and runs well. 10/10",True
1091500,"A bit too much talk for my taste early, but it picks up quick and is very well made. Quite an enjoyable game,",True
1091500,"the game on release was utter dog shit, but as the years past and the constant updates to fix the game; it molded this game as amazing. the story path i went on was outstanding, the dialogue was great, and the combat was also clean. i highly recommend for anyone to get this game and experience it themselves even if it was already spoiled to them. this game also proves that consumers shouldn't rush the game devs to release games early and wait until the game is actually finished to play it.",True
1091500,"Pros: the graphics, characters, effects and battle dynamics are excellent. the variety of weapons is enough. the characters are each like the real thing and taste more like a movie than a game. it's like an experience. this game makes you count down the days to do the next part. it's nice to have a role-playing game and direct it to different ends, but it takes a while to fully learn the game. you may want to play the game constantly because there are many kills and ways to play.

Cons: vehicle and motorcycle driving physics are bad. it turns too much and can go crooked. npcs are so stupid because he jumps in front of the car, dies, and as if that wasn't enough, the cops show up next to him 5 seconds later. if you're not a good player, keep the difficulty level down because they don't die. bugs still persist in the game, although not as much as before. it is quite possible to see 1-2 pieces every time you play. it's like rendering late and having the vehicles spawn in an instant.

Overall: just buy and play it. it's really worth it :)",True
1091500,"Best game I've ever played. The graphics are immersive, the story is compelling and the gameplay it self is very enjoyable.",True
1091500,Played and completed this game when it was at the buggy 1.0 and I loved it then and love it all the more in its polished glory. The developers really know how to make a world feel lived in and in turn immerse the player into the mindset that makes them want to scrape and crawl to the finish.,True
1091500,graphics are amazing,True
1091500,"love this game so much. i like open world games and being able to basically become max level before the first mission.

So thats what i did, i dont like playing games and only getting the cool stuff and abilities towards the end or having them unlocked through newgame+, no i want to be top dog right out the pound.

multiple endings is also a good choice to have, probably only going to play it once but its dope to play it and see how i compared to my friends and what not

9.99/10",True
1091500,saur good i had to acquire through legitimate means to support the devs. played during the rocky launch - was still phenom. VAs and writers really went absolutely insane & more than made up for the bugs at the time,True

Dulu waktu pertama keluar saya ingat banyak sekali bugnya.
Salut untuk developer game ini CD Projekt Red, bisa merubah game ini dari unplayable menjadi luar biasa seperti ini. (meski butuh waktu 4 tahun).
Buat teman2 di Indonesia, harus coba game ini sekali seumur hidup.
",True
1091500,"I love this game so much. Might be my favorite game ever, except that I played it first on PS4 Pro the day it came out and remember what that was like. Even then though it still had one of the greatest worlds and stories I had ever experienced. The pain of realizing I couldn't do basic things like customize cars or scale legendary weapons into the late game (I remember dumping thousands of materials into silverhand's pistol only for it to still be weaker than an epic revolver) was eased with free patches. The game now is a masterpiece. Loses points for having a final mission that is eternally in your quest log. (ala Fallout New Vegas) 9/10",True
1091500,"this is more than just a good looking game and a next gen technology show off. this is life. I don't want to finish this game, let Hanako wait in Amber forever. please add new Story DLC.",True
1091500,"9/10. The story was amazing and hooked me in every time i loaded it up, not experienced that feeling since half life/portal series and gta v when it first came out. So glad they polished it and worked the severe bugs out! Been on my wish list since it came on steam. Just finished the main story right before i wrote this and i want more! Will get the Phantom Liberty DLC!",True
1091500,super fun and addicting. lots of builds and replayablity,True
1091500,"Truly one of the best games I've ever played. The world building and setting are absolutely top tier accompanying a narrative with tough thought provoking choices and meaningful consequences. Before Cyberpunk I'd never had the pleasure of exploring a world so immaculately detailed and well thought out as Night City. In addition to an unrivaled setting, the game play is a deep well of build variety and moment to moment choice to tackle each challenge however you the as the player see fit. This is a must play by any and all standards.",True
1091500,"Still has some minor bugs, but overall this game is a great experience.",True

Overall I'd give this a 10/10",True
1091500,"Just best game I've ever played.

Play with mods that improve immersion, don't fast travel anywhere and take time to do side quests. You won't be disappointed. Also Phantom Liberty is great, get it.",True
1091500,"Very Fun with story that grabbed me personally. But if your wanting to mod. just be careful though. It can either be a painful brain dance, Or simple.",True
1091500,Great game. Haven't met any bugs so far. Think the patch really helped out the game. The expansion seems great too.,True

1091500,"Cyberpunk has been the most enjoyable game I have ever played. The story is amazing and immersive, the game does not force you on a certain path and I feel like the game builds upon much of what makes the witcher 3, fallout 4 and even mass effect games fun. Resulting in an experience which I don't believe to be matched by anything else. Also the DLC is amazing.

That being said, there are things which could have been done better. 
- Inventory management and crafting system can take time getting used to.
- Many of the character builds which could be fun to play on are not obvious and trying them out requires commitment which can't be reversed.
- The open nature of the game means you are likely to miss out on logbooks, quests and alternative endings. All of which could help you understand the world better and get more out of the game.
- Cyberpunk is also at least somewhat more gpu intensive that it has to be due to poorly implemented TAA anti aliasing and upscaling. These are issues with many modern games and I can only hope that CDPR and the industry in general moves away from this direction in the future.",True
1091500,"Great story, great combat, great gameplay..  Hell yeah i recommend this game!",True
1091500,The Graphics and the immersion really blew me away. The DLC could be it's own game. Put 52 hours into the game and still have so much more to do.,True
1091500,Just finished my 100% playthrough of the game. Absolutely without a doubt a 10/10 game. Up there with my favorite games of all time. Did a playthrough back when the game released and I'm happy to say the game is 110% better now. Highly recommend this fantastic game!,True
1091500,In this more or less final version the game is really great whether it be that you get lost in sidequests or follow the detailed main story line getting to know Night City in and out.,True
1091500,"I bought this game back in December of 2022. I remember having a ""meh"" attitude towards the whole game. The intro as a NOMAD, fixing your current car at the time, trying to become a known legend in Night City, I was not drawn in immediately. Meeting Jackie for the first time and doing the shoot-out with him smuggling an iguana, that was as far as I gotten back then. For a little over two years I did not pick up this game. I saw memes and bugs online and it made me more disinterested as time went on.

A friend of mine recommended that I give Cyberpunk 2077 another shot after I told him I have beaten God of War. When I tell you that I am currently addicted to this game, words can not describe the euphoria I have experienced lately. I have not had this much fun since Red Dead Redemption 2 came out back in 2018. The story telling and atmosphere is up there with some of the best rpgs I have ever played.

It is not perfect, but since CD Projekt Red has teased possibly a few more updates, there is no complaint from me here. My entire play through so far, I have experienced one crash: it involved doing several quick hacks against enemies and exploding a vehicle beside me. There have been npc's on the streets of Night City that would float above the ground when sitting. I experienced a bug once where my car would just drive in loops around my character, impeding my chances of getting in. Of all the hours I have put in, those have been minor inconveniences compared to stuff I experienced in 2022.

It took me about two hours to reach Night City and that is where things started picking up. The more you play and explore, you find yourself having a better understanding on how to play and interact with the game: cyber ware, crafting, upgrading guns, receiving free cool cars through missions, exploring areas, and finding unique items or guns (SKIPPY). Following through the main story or doing a side missions are well written and captivating.

From a gonk of a launch, to a truly special game. If you were skeptical of trying the game regarding it's history, now is the time to give it another chance.",True
1091500,"It didn't fully meet my expectations, but it offered an above-average open world, enjoyable side quests, and a decent storyline, making for an overall fun experience. However, inconsistencies, bugs, and performance issues hindered my enjoyment. 7/10 – A good game. (I'm playing again after the new update and some issues seem to have been resolved)",True
1091500,"Beautiful game with very high replay ability, there is some minor visual bug and some quest is still bugged but nothing too major, highly recommended 8/10",True
1091500,"Played when the game had originally dropped in 2020, and despite the bugs and glitches i had a blast and was invested in such a memorable story and setting. Now, having played it a 2nd time after all the updates and fixes, as well as the DLC, I can say this game has solidified itself as a true classic amongst the titans of the gaming industry. And absolute must-play, the ending still brings a tear to my eye.",True
1091500,"In this game, you can shoot people, and run them over. Also your character can have some very cool aesthetic features. I don't know what the plot is about, but, 10/10 game.",True
1091500,"You know, I remember seeing gameplay of this game when it first came out. I endlessly ragged on this game for just about everything from bugs to gameplay to what appeared at the time to be a shallow world. 

Right now, I'm playing through all my games in a desperate ""No Backlog"" challenge attempt, so that doesn't leave me much time to pursue side objectives in most of these games. However, I couldn't help myself here. I actually became quite immersed in everything this game had to offer. The combat was fun as hell and made me feel like a badass. I genuinely started to care for the characters and the results of my actions on the world around me. If I was near a side objective, I did it. If it was for a character I enjoyed, I did it. 

All this to say that I was genuinely impressed, and whatever insults I offered this game on launch, I take it back and instead offer my suggestion to absolutely try this game out. The ending was phenomenal and truly respects the character development and choices made along the way. I didn't even have Phantom Liberty and was quite satisfied.

Worth the time, and I'll likely come back in the end.",True
1091500,"There are few moments that as a gamer you'd know a game is just more than a game, and this is one of those experiences. you'll be certainly in for something more than what you're expecting.

Gameplay: 

Various routes to build your character for combat and interaction with the world. each life route also provides a good insight to the world. The world is immersive and big to explore, my hours are low because I already spent longer hours on a different platform, but throughout over 600+ hours of playing in total, never once the game play was tiresome.

Story:

As I said each life path gives a decent insight to the world, but when you start it does a perfect job of roleplaying if you only select the related dialogue options for you path. Story is so immersive and character developments and story-telling is so perfect, that even after playing each ending, you'd still feel the certain highs as you did playing the first time.

DLC:

Adds a good chunk to both gameplay and story, while you can be fine just playing the base game, it's certainly worth the price.",True
1091500,"buggy but some glitches make ya laugh,all though preem game fun weapons and good story",True
1091500,"Great game, character, narrative and setting. Game has some glitches, but nothing near bethesda level. Fun all around and a good campaign. Wish we had more stellar first person narratives nowadays.",True
1091500,"Just finished my first ending after finishing all the gigs and most side jobs.

The game has a lot of moments where it's really good thought provoking and hype. But it's so rough around the edges mostly because of inconsistentcey with decision making and the consequences of being inconsistent. The couple endings I've seen so far end on the climax without enough of a real conclusion in my opinion. This isn't helped by the fact time spent with characters is too limited to become invested in any of them properly. All the side job and gig characters endings feel too abrupt and as if the team had to finish them to finish the product in time for a deadline instead of tell a full story. Also dialogue is stiff and sound just kinda dumb in some scenes.  Except Johnny because he's with you the whole game and does develop and change over time with V depending on how you act which is what I would have liked more from other characters. Johnny's character, development and conclusion is by far my favourite part of the game.

Unfortunately the whole game feels like it's just better to wait for the sequel which will improve upon all the many minor issues with this game which hold it back from being one of the greats. Especially as it's still littered with major bugs even on the 2.2 patch. The games main strengths are it's immersive, atmospheric and is backed by an awesome fitting soundtrack but it most importantly is very fun (especially the combat) so it's still worth playing for sure if you're interested.

7.5/10",True
1091500,"I played the Cyberpunk 2077 PS4 day one release version, by many considered to be the worst version of the game. About 2/3rds of the way through the slog I gave up. The game just wasn't worth playing, and I was hardly the only one who felt this way. Many updates later it finally reached a state where many people have now come around to it. Though the game is far more enjoyable then it was on release and I would recommend it, I personally feel like it still has some fundamental issues that run deeper than bugs and combat.

2077 only superficially resembles the original TTRPG. While elements like slang give dialog a great level of authenticity, many core pillars of Cyberpunk are absent from this digital version of Night City. While I'm sad to see fun elements like Posergangs (gangs who get plastic surgery to look like celebrities) go, I believe that there are two core features that are instrumental to the ""Cyberpunk experience"" that 2077 is lacking:

[h2] 1. Role Playing [/h2]
Cyberpunk is first and foremost a Role Playing Game. Night City is merely a thematic backdrop for characters created by passionate players to explore choices, themes, and stories. 2077's protagonist, V, is a supremely written character but that is exactly the issue. V is a pre-written character like Geralt in the Witcher, and is fundamentally closer to Fallout 4's Nate/Nora than any TTRPG player character. Though V is given depth in writing, the player is given no depth of choice. Nowhere is this clearer than in the player's interactions with the character of Johnny Silverhand. If the player blindly aligns themselves with Silverhand's ideals or completely opposes them, his character makes sense. However, if the player handles Johnny's many remarks with the nuance they deserve his character quickly becomes confusing. Nuance makes Johnny come off as a try-hard contrarian, someone who bases their entire personality on always being different; both from other people and from other's expectations. This feels like incredible character depth... until you realize the game doesn't allow you to acknowledge it in any way. This wasn't masterful writing, it's an accident. It's the game's limited reactivity laid bare. Johnny isn't someone who hides his real feeling away behind layers upon layers of irony, sarcasm, and contrarianism, he's just a complete and utter jackass (read: hero) who keeps talking about his cock every chance he gets. The only real question the game poses on Johnny, the second most important character in this story-driven ""RPG"", is whether you think his actions were justified. The entire game is like this. Simple binary choices. Sometimes you get to use your skills in dialog for some extra money or to bypass a combat section, but rarely do you get to define who V is as a character because that has already been determined for you.

[h2] 2. HumanityPunk [/h2]
Humanity is a core theme in Cyberpunk to the point it even has an associated stat. In the TTRPG it is directly related to your character's empathy. Installing cyberware (bionic implants) risks insanity, and only highly empathetic characters can reap the benefits of multiple cybernetic enhancements without losing their humanity. This core concept is completely absent from V as a character. NPCs get a handful of military implants and go psycho but V can replace their entire body with machine parts and suffer no consequences. The reason humanity is so important to Cyberpunk's identity is because it's dystopian trans-humanist setting is all about stories centered on humanity's continued perseverance. It's about human emotion, tragedy, relationships, fighting for your beliefs, burning out rather than fading away. It's punk. Nowhere is this more clear than in the game's anime series, Cyberpunk: Edgerunner. It is no accident that Edgerunners completely revitalized interest in the game. It embodies all the great thematic qualities inherent to Cyberpunk-- qualities that 2077 only flirts with. Humanity as it is understood in the TTRPG is at the forefront of the series, and it makes for one of the most exciting, unique, and heart wrenching anime of the past decade. This quality is a double-edged sword; it exposed how lacking 2077 was in comparison. The game feels directionless, meandering. It only hints at themes instead of going all out. It has well-written characters, but they are just there to make up for the human struggles that V lacks. None of it is punk, it's just cyber.

Despite my criticisms I do feel Cyberpunk 2077 is a game worth playing. The combat system is vastly improved over the original release and now allows for ~3 core playstyles. The gunplay itself is so-so, but everything surrounding it like movement, special abilties, hacks, and slow motion make it engaging. Stats and the skill tree now actually feel meaningful, though this is largely limited to combat. The characters that you interact with are authentically written and acted, even if they aren't very punk. I like that they left some room in Night City for more human experiences. An example of this would be how a side character runs a new age spiritualism shop and will read you tarot. That seems out of place in a cybernetic future, but that's exactly what makes it feel authentic and human. What I especially like is that V's romance options are gender-specific but that the game still lets you embarrass yourself by flirting with someone who is not interested. Characters feel more real when they aren't just prizes to be won as part of the player's wish fulfillment.

At the end of the day Cyberpunk 2077 is a semi-competent open world action game in a setting loosely inspired by the Cyberpunk TTRPG. It lacks choices and thematic depth/consistency, but generally creates an engaging experience through combat gameplay and writing. If you like slightly generic open world games that constantly drip-feed you dopamine by having you travel towards a marker and then shooting a couple guys there, this game is for you. 

[h3] ""The game isn't punk, and that's the most punk thing about it."" [/h3]

[b] nit-picky rant bit [/b]
Here's some smaller things that shouldn't really matter but they annoyed me so now I'm gonna annoy you:
- In-game radio is godawful. I know CDPR commissioned a bunch of songs for the game. I think they should get their money back. Still cry everytime ""I wanna stay at your house"" comes on though.
- Cameos. I like Kojima and his classic Kojimbo rambling and thought Jesse Cox did a great job voicing his character. That said, Grimes' delivery was so impressively bad that I can still feel the second-hand embarrassment. But hey, at least she's consistent in her talent.
- CDPR spent so much time developing all these gangs and their identities only to use them as disposable fodder.
- There's technically a lot of clothing but most of it is reskins of the same few items. There's way more pieces of clothing in the game than what you can get but CDPR doesn't want us to be drippy so all we got is this mediocre wardrobe.
- City feels kinda artificial (in a bad way). Witcher 3's towns all felt pretty lively but in 2077 I often find myself thinking about how unnatural things look and feel.
- Couldn't romance Aurore Cassel from the DLC. I know I previously said wish fulfillment is bad but in this specific case I retract that statement because it suits me.
- Tiered loot is lazy and mostly based on the level you are.
- Can't change the skin on a gun, which is silly. Also don't know what skin an attachment has until you equip it.
- Speaking of skins, the game has a feature where you can copy a car's skin, but this only works on very specific vehicles for arbitrary reasons.
- There's ripperdocs other than Viktor (he's my ride or die)
- This entire section was honestly just an excuse to talk about the Grimes thing, I'm still surprised that made it into the game.
- Cars in a game like this don't need realistic physics simulations, just make them fun to drive.",True
1091500,"CD Projekt RED kinda redeemed themselves with the update and DLC. But the final product still feel a lot less like what they promised in the trailer. Hopefully Orion won't have the same issue. For me, the gameplay is great and feel smooth, i can have variation in combat and doesn't feel bored. The main story is an 8/10 and the side quest is the usual CD Projekt RED side quest, mostly nice, leaning into our morality in it's decision. But can't help to feel a bit underwhelmed compared to The witcher 3. So, don't expect the same quality from both games.",True
1091500,"Wow. Just wow.

I've put in around 300 hours into this game 50/50 split here and on console. I've experience 3 of the 6 different endings, and of the 3 I've seen, they are so worth it. Cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece through-n-through. I'll break it up into sections, and I promise not to spoil anything that's not in the trailers or stuff like that, but this game has been out for so long and has had its' fair share of press over the years.

V: I have never been so immersed into a character....ever. V truly is whoever you want them to be. Their origin, their journey, their finale. I played Male V first, then Female V. Both are done to perfection. They have little differences that change everything about them, yet they are the same character. Male V is just sick of everyone's BS all the time, and Female V has this sound of hopeful spirit in her voice. It's fair to say you'll spend a lot time with V and you will have a preference. I mean to say that they are not identical in their mannerisms, tones and if you ever see comparison videos of the two in cut scenes, you'll tell! I have to give a massive shout out to Gavin Drea (Male V) and Cherami Leigh (Female V) as well as CDPR. You killed it! Especially with lockdown and Gavin recording in London and Cherami in Los Angeles. You will love V, no matter what. Trust me.

Never Fade Away: The story is superb! Again, no spoilers. You all know that Keanu Reeves makes a appearance in this game and my god...I'll get to him next. Story is so rich and full of meaningful characters -and I mean besides the occasional 20 min side mission - everyone stands out. The game is split into 3 acts all of which have very identifiable characteristics. I wont get into the nitty gritty but I will say that the pacing is great! Unless you are 100%ing it then it takes forever but that's my doing. You will cry, you will laugh, you will cringe and you will have one helleva time. 

Wake the F*** up, Samurai: Keanu f****** Reeves. Easily steals the show whenever he is there and trust me, he's there! He plays a rocker boy called Johnny Silverhand and...yeah, breathtaking. So stellar and by the later half of this run I would skip most dialogue unless it was him. He's like Jack Sparrow meets Gordon Ramsey. Johnny and V mesh perfectly together and truly form a symbiotic relationship together. Not in a weird way but a kickass way. For male V he is like the most loyal brother you could wish for and for Female V is like the annoying younger brother who has some valuable pointers but she just wants to go by her day. 

The City of Dreams: There is no better world design than Night City. None. It is so goddamn gorgeous. If you can run it with raytracing it's 1000 times better. The neon lights and truly ""bladerunner"" vibes never gets old. I've caught myself wasting hours just driving around the city at night looking at the massive ads everywhere illuminating the night sky. Truly unbelievable. The outskirts of Night City feel like outskirts in all the right ways as it's integral to one (or two) of the many story lines. It's not bland with nothing to do, though Night City is so addicting. All the areas have such distinct characteristics and you will always know where you are just by the environment. The world (though they promised more) is still crazy. The people you meet become so connected to Night City and it's many districts that you'll see them as one in the same thing. I can't say enough about this and how incredible a job they did by making a truly believable city with our societal, economic and political ways. 

PHANTOM LIBERTY: This is the DLC for the game (again no spoilers except one) and it can provide an alternate ending for V. You meet more memorable people and another celebrity (Idris Elba), face more strong narrative choices and it truly bumps the game's experience up a notch. When I played the game on Xbox, obviously this wasn't made yet and I loved the game. But when this came out, it brought a massive update known as 2.0. Which literally turned this game into Cyberpunk 2077 2.0. The progression, the customisation, the upgrades, the games performance....it became what it was set out to be back in 2020. All of this stuff is free to everyone besides the DLC section but yeah damn, Phantom Liberty is so worth it as it (Like CDPR's Witcher 3) is long. It added about 25 more hours to the game as my latest run was at 70 hrs. Waiting for a sale is never a bad idea but if you can buy it at full price, do it. You will not regret it. 

For 100%ing: Oh boy, this game took me...well you can see. Over 100hrs to beat. It wasn't hard but it was a grind. I chose to do all the side missions and Phantom Liberty as soon as they popped up which made the game run so damn long lol. It was worth it to me as I love this game. It does have 2-3 achievements that aren't tied to just playing the game. What I mean is like ""throw a grenade, hack someone and do this blah blah blah all at once"" which you would never do naturally. Look up the achievements once you've finished the game as they are easy to miss. 

You're Breathtaking!: Overall this is worth every penny and is truly a monumental story. The game had major problems at the start, as you may all know. But I believed in this games success and I am so happy that it worked out. This is the No Mans Sky of single player games. Truly a remarkable recovery and a breathtaking experience. One last thing about this game. It's a warning. That is it's biggest strength. If we don't change our ways, we will have Night City (Night City is Los Angeles, FYI). The corruption, the complete economic disarray. The whole kit and caboodle. It's actually polarising, and yet shockingly familiar to our world. Just something I've found interesting. I know I wrote a thesis on this lol but to me this game deserves it.

See you in the Major Leagues!
Love you, bye!",True

1091500,"Overall, I really enjoyed this game. Story was interesting, characters were engaging, combat was varied and exciting. Glad I waited until I upgraded my hardware and for CDPR to work out the kinks.

Phantom Liberty was awesome.",True
1091500,"Overwhelmingly YES! This game ******* rocks and scratches that itch for a true action RPG experience. Ironically I'm not a big FPS guy anymore but the moment to moment gun play and systems are done so well. I keep finding myself year after year coming back to this game. The community is great, the developers never gave up on their baby and it is truly a masterclass of art, direction and themes. On high end systems, everyone knows that this is a MUST BUY. Great way to benchmark your rig and get some pretty great flicks off of photo mode. This is a comfort game to me that I'm sure years from now I'll be happy to either boot back up or look happily upon it. Also, tons of mods that just are *chef's kiss* (cosmetic, gameplay, engine tweaking, and some pretty elaborate dev/mod menus) I wait patiently for the Witcher 4 and hope that the next release follows the labor of love treatment Cyberpunk got. Thank you CDPR for a phenomenal experience over the past 4 years.",True
1091500,"Genuinely one of the best games out there. This game is a high i've been chasing since its release, and I'm sorely disappointed that there wont be more content released. I can remember just about every side quest, every unique weapon, every cybernetic, etc. The game is incredible and easily one of the most fun open world games ive ever played. I have had hours of fun just fighting enemies, especially maxtac. 

If you want a unique, fun, first person sandbox game that doesn't waste your time and has mechanics that rival the most intense movement shooters AND the best of stealth games, this is it. I only wish we could have had a second DLC.",True
1091500,"Game is amazing! Great story, Great gameplay and world. T he world. Is alive and interesting. From small gigs that give cash to robbing Arasaka you are free to do pretty much anything. if you are thinking of buying it.. Do it",True
1091500,"After 5 years of patching and a GPU upgrade, I can finally recommend this game. It feels like a mix between GTA 5 & Deus Ex games",True
1091500,"Amazing game, gorgeous graphics and great story line. Revolutionary game especially for the genre it's probably the GOAT. <3",True
1091500,"Played this first on PS5 for over 900 hours. This game offers such a rich and immersive world to explore and I can't seem to stop, so I bought it for pc as well :D
Plus the photo mode that recently got even more updated makes me even more obsessed! But I wish there were more normal poses without getting mods to do this. :)
<3",True
1091500,"It's funny how with each year the subplots from the game get more and more relatable to the real world, the graphics better and the mod support wider.",True
1091500,"Playing Cyberpunk 2077 over four years after release is a completely different experience than when it launched. The myriads of game breaking bugs and underbaked or entirely non-existent promised features have all been resolved, and now it has become one of the most visually immersive and detailed video games on the market.

Nothing quite compares to Night City; it is truly the games’ strongest aspect as you will find yourself constantly drawn into the unique aesthetic and vibe of the city. Playing with path tracing elevates this to the next level, as it completely transforms the game. When it comes to graphics, Cyberpunk is best in class.

The main story is pretty good. The characters you meet mostly have a personality and the story kept me interested the whole way through. Combat was also good, with great variety in weapon type and satisfying feedback. Vehicles and driving were also another highlight, with a wide variety of cars that were easily obtainable and all being fun to drive. The soundtrack is also excellent.

The game is far from perfect though. The biggest issue I have is the illusion of choice the game has. The choices you make prior to the point of no return have virtually no impact on the ending you receive, or the outcome of certain quests. The game draws you in with ‘unique’ life-paths (nomad, corpo, street kid), but these offer nothing but random dialogue options that exist as nothing but flavour text. Its particularly disappointing because it is advertised as a defining choice that will shape your playthrough, which it simply does not.

I also found the game incredibly easy. I was disappointed that there wasn’t much of a challenge that forced me to optimise my build to tackle certain missions or bosses. It felt like a waste of such a unique combat system.

Some side quests are also incredibly dull, and the sheer amount of them combined with the various gigs and simple combat missions scattered throughout the city felt as if they were simply a means to increase the games length.

Crafting is also completely meaningless, and the skill trees are vast and complex, yet mild in their actual impact – but these are only minor gripes.

What resolves all the above is the Phantom Liberty DLC. It is hands down the best DLC I have ever played in a game. The narrative and characters are immersive and engaging, and the environment of Dogtown is stunning. It is truly the summation of the strongest aspects of Cyberpunk. Unfortunately, this elevation from the base game in almost every aspect works against itself as the DLC (which is played out roughly half-way through the game) feels tonally different and almost out of place because of how good it is. 

Overall, Cyberpunk 2077 is excellent. Playing for the first time in 2025 feels exactly like the Cyberpunk that was originally promised all those years ago. It has been refined over the years and is finally in a place that cements it as one of the action RPG greats.

Cyberpunk 2077: 8/10
Phantom Liberty: 10/10",True
1091500,"I've finally giving cyberpunk a try. 100 hours in, I've immersed in Night City, peeling it's onion layers one by one. I love the amount of details CDPR put in their world building. each gigs have deeper lore in them that you can find in other gigs or encounters. It's been a while since I jump into a lore rabbit-hole like this game has.

In my opinion, this game could expand more of it's features so that some of them wouldn't feel half-baked and/or put there just for the sake of it. So that the game can be even more immersive, since that's what CDPR are going for with first person view.",True
1091500,"After all the fixes this game will blow you away. The way every character your introduced to has an impact, an impression on your play through whether they live or die, it builds up such a fleshed out world. It also has you weigh heavily in on decisions nothing feels like the truly right choice only a path you could take, it’s so insane it’s to the point you’ll spends minutes even just on one dialogue option wondering if what your doing is really what you want for yourself or the other characters and how it could affect you down the line. The only complaint I could come up with in terms of gameplay is the  combat system, it isn’t perfect but makes up with it by the sheer amount of customization without making you feel lost. If the game is on sale you’d be an absolute gonk not to at least try it out",True
1091500,"I saw corps strip farmers of water ... and eventually of land. Saw them transform Night City into a machine fueled by people's crushed spirits, broken dreams and emptied pockets. Corps've long controlled our lives, taken lots... and now they're after our souls! V, I've declared war not because capitalism's a thorn in my side or outta nostalgia for an America gone by. This war's a people's war against a system that's spiralled outta our control. It's a war against the fuckin' forces of entropy, understand? Do whatever it takes to stop 'em, defeat 'em, gut 'em. If I gotta kill, I'll kill. If I need your body, I'll fuckin' take it! Fuckin' hell ... You still don't see it. But you will one day.

--Johnny Silverhand, Cyberpunk 2077",True
1091500,"Cyberpunk 2077 has been a fun experience so far, but I’ve lost count of how many times it has crashed on me. There have been moments where I genuinely thought a bug was part of a mission—only to log in the next day and realize, nope, it was just a glitch. The story itself is great, but the constant crashing and bugs make it overwhelming at times.

I had someone tell me they didn’t like GTA V, but honestly, Cyberpunk 2077 feels like the same kind of game, just set in a different time period. Actually, I’d say GTA V's graphics might even be better. CD Projekt Red is nowhere near Rockstar in terms of polish, but I do give them credit for trying. The game is definitely enjoyable, despite its flaws.

That said, one thing that bugs me (besides the literal bugs) is how sexuality is integrated into the game. I mean, throwing in a random dildo or some nudity? Whatever, that’s not a big deal. But when my character ends up in a one-night stand without me wanting to take it that far, it just feels unnecessary. Although… if it were Keanu Reeves’ Johnny Silverhand? Well, that might be a different story!",True
1091500,"""For folks like us? Wrong city, Wrong people.""

Literally no game like this nor will there ever be again probably. Once you finish a playthrough, you're just gonna start it up again. No other game can replicate the feeling of a more lived in world with these amazing characters.

Game is even better with mods!",True
1091500,"The main story line is good, keeps you playing. I would say that most everyday battles in the streets and the side quests are not too difficult, I have set to a lower difficulty. The boss battles are much more difficult and you will need a good level progression and cyberware to do well and defeat the enemies.",True

1091500,"pros: the characters, voice acting, visuals, diverse world, tons of content (missions, lore, random NPC dialogue, etc)
cons: combat can get pretty repetitive and the NPCs are very predictable( but maybe it's because I'm playing on normal, just sneakily crouching and head shooting everyone), the world feels like the devs had a lot of unfinished plans for it",True
1091500,"Runs surprisingly well on my 6 year old laptop. Any issues i encountered often didn't retract from the fun, and I thoroughly enjoyed the story. 
",True
1091500,Cyberpunk story is the best story game i've played in a while if u cut the gameplay it wll be another great movie. And i reccommend to buy DLC too it will take place between act 2 or 3 of the main game and the DLC story is really good too it gave us james bond vibe. Great game,True
1091500,"Ignoring launch, it is a beautiful game set in the most immersive city I've ever played. I beat it on console and played a little bit of the new updates, so I'll give my opinion. Very, very good story. Even a little unnervingly prophetic. A future we can avoid, but not one devoid of hope, just very full of the worst of humanity. Every character is well done and polished. Every build has a decently fun gameplay loop that differs in certain key ways. I think my only problem with the game is that it is actively killing my system while I try to play it on certain settings, like it's definitely pretty bad when nearly five years after release people are still using your game as the benchmark. And don't get me wrong, the game is absolutely pushing the limits of graphical fidelity and is a testament to how far we've come, but lord this game needs a data center to run well enough. And they aren't even using the REDEngine for their next project, so it's like all that to just switch over to Unreal Engine? Come on man.

Don't know if this is nearly the same CD Projekt Red as the one that made The Witcher III these days, but for what it's worth, this game ended up alright. They will not have a second chance to save a broken launch in this environment. My wallet can only take so many bad hits before I say ""I should just work on my backlog.""",True
1091500,"This game is absolutely incredible.... like, WHERE DO I BEGIN,  No spoilers doe :p",True
1091500,"This game has had my attention from the day I got it, It's just so much fun. I love the depth of which you can customize your character and how much freedom the game gives you from the second you get outta the prologue.",True
1091500,"Great game!

So much to do, lots of variety and fun!

Many different ways to play, and worth multiple play throughs. 

Driving machanics are good, better than GTA. 

Fighting mechanics are great, you can go stealth, melay, techy, or machine gun.

Totally worth it!",True
1091500,"Cyberpunk 2077 might very well be the worst release of a AAA video game in my lived experience. I spent a great deal of time since 2020 looking at CDPR's latest Open-World RPG as indicative of its loss of moral fiber and integrity; and its endless desire for Capital as a now-publically-traded company. 

It wasn't until Fall of 2024 that my older brother spoke out about his love for this title, and I decided to return to it on sale for $30.


I have an endless list of complaints for this game. I feel that CDPR has made a great deal of sacrifices in making this an open-world experience instead of a more tailor-made, linear game. In general, I find that open-world video games fail to meet my meagre expectations, and Cyberpunk 2077 is no exception on this front. The world is very static and unreactive, the consequences and choices to be made outside of quests are so negligible they will never impact your gameplay. The side-quest content in Cyperpunk 2077 is awful; and by and large it only exists to grant resources for those interested in grinding. The RPG-progression system is terrible, and its reworks have done very little to improve upon its initial, unplayable state.

Despite all of these complaints, the main storyline and quests of Cyberpunk 2077 are incredibly memorable, impactful, and thought-provoking. If this game existed only as the series of Main Quests provided, it would be a generally better experience. And despite the sacrifices made to make this game Open-World, the parts that survived are absolutely worth your time. Without any desire to spoil the experience, I recommend Cyberpunk 2077 for the sale price of 30$, and believe you will have a great time playing it for that price. I do not recommend this title at 60$, but it has a long history of deep discounts--try and buy it during the Summer or Winter Sales.

1091500,"if you are thinking about buying this game, BUY THIS GAME it is amazing and far better than at launch with such a vibrant and lively world. the show can not do it enough justice",True
1091500,The graphics are so awesome.  Great story and keeps you interested.,True
1091500,"This game is insanely hard to put down once you pick it up. I've done a run for all 3 of the life paths. In my second run (Corpo), I did every gig and NCPD job, have tried all the cool cyberware and still want to play more and more. Super addicting story, characters, DLC, etc. It's simply peak. 1000/10 would highly recommend.",True
1091500,"At first I was iffy about playing this game because when it first became popular with let’s players it was a glitchy unplayable mess. After some years I came back and I decided to give the game real chance. And after playing I can say I LOVE this game! The story is great, the futuristic aesthetic is amazing, and I love the subtle world building.

My only complaints are the lack of love interest and the car driving mechanics. I feel like I’m driving like the toys for Toy Story 2, every turn felt so sensitive but it’s not that bad when riding a motorcycle. Back to the love interest, I’m surprised there’s only 2 options for either female and male V. I don’t mind giving the love interest their own sexual orientations but if you’re going to do so the options should be plentiful for each gender. And they should also change the dialogue with the different V’s, why is Panam flirting with my female V when she doesn’t even want her fr. If they weren’t going to change the dialogue they shouldn’t have added restrictions and made it so either V had a chance. Idk these are small gripes that don’t take away from the gameplay or story. I still believe Cyberpunk is an amazing game and that people should give it a chance!",True
1091500,Truly a masterpiece in its current form after all these years and terrible release. This game is so story rich and the replayability is off the charts. It will have you wanting to playthrough all the different endings. Even the side characters and their quest lines are in depth and will have you questioning your morality as you make decisions that impact not only their life but V's.,True
1091500,Jogo muito bom e imersivo. Tem lacração mas não chegou a atrapalhar tanto a gameplay.,True
1091500,"What an incredible experience. Just finished my first playthrough. Did absolutely everything i could and ended up with 107 hours. I had some interest in the game initially but never played or bought it due to the massive flop it was at launch. Later, i heard it was fixed and amazing and it was always on my backburner of games to play, but i just never got around to it. Im super glad i finally did.

Pretty much everything about it was amazing. I did feel a bit overwhelmed early on but other than that, it was smooth sailing. I think i only had one crash during my 107 hours. There were a few very minor bugs (like my car spawns in the sky and falls down to the road), but nothing that really was of any concern.

Im sad that my time in nightcity has came to an end. Im already considering another play through. Do a totally different build and pick different options this time.",True

1091500,"After few years of patching this game, after 2.0 patch, there is no other game with such juicy, immersive gameplay and first of all - atmosphere pouring out of the screen. I practically don't use fast travel system, because I drive slowly trough the Nigh City in my 911, Silverhand is chilling with me. Looking up, I see a city designed in chaotic beauty - office buildings, monumental blocks, AVs, viaducts, cables. Looking down, I see punks, or maybe nomads, or maybe rich people consumed by consumerism, it depends of district. It's nice to slow down sometimes and to inhale the air of this city.
Gameplay and difficulty level is something you need to try. No excuses.
It depends of you if you want to be a shadow, or a tank, but I think trying to be yourself is the best option - you can't eat a cake and have a cake.
If you know CDProjekt, you have to know, that the narration and story are at the highest level. Details, Easter Eggs, original stories, genitals.
They redeemed their sins after a failed debut and now you have one of the greatest AAA games in history.",True

",True
1091500,"Cyberpunk 2077 has evolved into one of the most immersive and exhilarating experiences in modern gaming. With the release of Phantom Liberty, CD Projekt Red has not only solidified its reputation but also raised the bar for open-world RPGs. From its deep narrative to its mind-blowing visuals, here’s a rundown of everything cool you can do in the world of Cyberpunk 2077 and the Phantom Liberty expansion.

A World Like No Other-
Night City is alive in a way that few game worlds can rival. The neon-lit streets pulse with energy, full of dangerous alleys, upscale penthouses, and everything in between. Whether you're speeding down a highway on a motorcycle, walking through crowded marketplaces, or simply soaking in the stunning architecture, the world feels real. The addition of Phantom Liberty expands this world even further, introducing the new area of Dogtown—a lawless district with a gritty, dystopian vibe that’s as dangerous as it is fascinating.

Incredible Character Customization-
In Cyberpunk 2077, you create a character that’s uniquely yours. The customization options are vast, from your appearance to your cybernetic enhancements, which not only look cool but also impact gameplay. You can become a smooth-talking Netrunner hacking into systems, a deadly solo mercenary tearing through enemies, or a techie creating gadgets that make you a force to be reckoned with. The Phantom Liberty DLC adds even more layers to the gameplay, with new abilities and cyberware that further shape your playstyle.

Epic Storytelling & Choices-
The heart of Cyberpunk 2077 is its narrative. With Phantom Liberty, you’re thrust into a thrilling spy-like plot, working with (or against) the mysterious Solomon Reed and navigating through a world of high stakes and shady alliances. Every decision you make shapes the outcome, from the characters you help to the factions you align with. The voice acting is top-tier, and the complex relationships you form with allies, enemies, and even the city itself, are some of the best in RPGs.

Combat and Action-
Combat in Cyberpunk 2077 feels fluid and intense, whether you’re using traditional guns, futuristic tech, or your fists. The new weapons in Phantom Liberty, like the ""Liberty"" pistol, are a blast to use, and the expanded skill trees let you refine your approach. You can stealth your way through missions, hacking cameras and security systems to avoid detection, or you can go in guns blazing, engaging in fast-paced shootouts with deadly enemies. The level of freedom you have in combat, combined with the variety of weapons and gadgets at your disposal, makes every encounter feel fresh.

Vehicles and Exploration-
Night City isn’t just a place to fight—it’s a place to explore. The game offers a huge array of vehicles, from sleek sports cars to brutal motorcycles. You can race through the streets at lightning speed, or simply cruise along the coastlines of the Pacifica district, enjoying the breathtaking views. Phantom Liberty introduces new vehicles to the mix, including some with special modifications that can help you evade enemies or tackle tough missions.

Cyberware and Augmentations-
One of the coolest aspects of Cyberpunk 2077 is the cyberware system. You can install all sorts of upgrades, from neural processors that enhance your ability to hack, to robotic limbs that make you a wrecking machine in combat. The Phantom Liberty DLC adds even more enhancements, such as advanced implants that allow you to hack into enemy systems, manipulate the battlefield, and gain the upper hand in ways you’ve never seen before.

The Music and Atmosphere-
Cyberpunk 2077 would be nowhere near as amazing without its atmospheric soundtrack, which pulls you deep into the cyberpunk vibe. The score, mixed with the pulse of techno, industrial, and synthwave, keeps you hyped as you tear through Night City. The addition of new music in Phantom Liberty only amplifies the sense of being in a futuristic, dystopian world where danger is always just around the corner.

Engaging Side Content-
Beyond the main story, there’s a wealth of side content that ensures you’ll never run out of things to do. From fixing up cars, to engaging in dangerous gigs for shady clients, to participating in street races, Cyberpunk 2077 makes sure you’re always immersed in something exciting. Phantom Liberty brings new activities and factions that expand the lore even more, making every corner of the world feel rich with possibilities.

Graphics and Visuals-
Simply put, the visuals are breathtaking. The city is a living, breathing entity, with day-night cycles, weather changes, and stunning environmental details. The graphical improvements from the base game to the Phantom Liberty expansion are also evident, with even more attention to detail in textures, lighting, and character models. From neon signs reflecting off wet pavement to the awe-inspiring vistas of the outskirts of the city, it’s a visual feast that’s hard to look away from.

Phantom Liberty: A Must-Play DLC-
Phantom Liberty takes Cyberpunk 2077 to the next level. It introduces an entirely new narrative filled with twists and turns, alongside brand-new characters, missions, and challenges. The expansion focuses on espionage, political intrigue, and a shadowy world that feels even more dangerous and exciting than before. The new location, Dogtown, is a fresh playground that’s perfect for anyone who loves the chaos of the Cyberpunk world. The stakes are higher, and the action is even more intense.

1091500,"Despite the rough launch everyone seems to talk about, purchasing the game now is definitely worth it. I love the story, game play, graphics and everything. 
The skill tree makes possible to have an infinite amount of play styles to complete the game. 
Want to do it stealthily? You can do that. 
Want to go in guns blazing? You can do that. 
Want to be a movement demon? You. Can. Do. That.

If you're thinking of buying it, just go for it. And if you like it? Get the dlc as well.",True

1091500,"This game has been in my library for a long time.  I came from the days of the Cyberpunk pen and paper rollplaying game and this game scratches that nostalgia itch for sure.  On the surface, the game has amazing graphics, gunplay, story, and overall feel.  10/10 game.",True
1091500,"Cyberpunk is the modern Skyrim, it offers nothing a title of its caliber shouldn't have as a modern release.

If you like to murder hobo this is the game for you.",True
1091500,"One of the best story telling, action, romance games i ever played. Big open world map with many missions to do even when you're done with the main story. Lots of content.

Play it for story and will get very good experience.
Night City is an ugly, vulgar, sadistic man eating monster. 
This game has superb side stories, which extend the main story and give it more impact.
A solid play through takes 40-60 hours (without the add-on). You should check Mods for this game. You can add wild stuff to game :-)

If you only want to mess around, then GTA or Just Cause is a better pick.",True
1091500,Greatest game in the world. I would have never have known if it wasnt for edgerunners. When i first played the game i was a nomad who glitched into walls and couldnt move past anything. But after edgerunners released so did one of the best updates every that initially fixed it all. Its like the cuffed of restraint finally got broken and you could breath the toxic fresh air of night city for the first time.  Have played thru this game multiple times . A few on my playstation and some on my rog ally with mods. I most likely will play again and again because this game just has that much content. 10/10 worth every penny,True

1091500,"One of the most immersive, story-rich and best games out there, it is no wonder that this game sits at the top 5 games I've ever played. Preem stuff choom.",True
1091500,"great game, and the replay value is high. so many things to do and the fact that they're still pushing out updates for it makes it worth the money",True
1091500,"The Cyberpunk story is very engaging, and I would recommend playing it while also completing all the side quests, as they add more depth to the overall experience. Gameplay-wise, it’s great, but some builds are definitely better than others. That being said, I don’t fully understand the lock system that only allows you to reset your build a couple of times. For me, it doesn’t make much sense, as the more you play, the better you get at recognizing the build you want to stick with, or you might just want to try something different.

Driving in the game is a bit lackluster; most cars handle poorly, with the exception of the more sporty ones, which drive much better. Since I played way after launch, the only bugs I encountered were minor visual glitches or some NPCs acting weird, but nothing that would break the game.

The graphics are probably some of the best out there, and with new technologies like DLSS and AMD FSR, you can probably run the game on a mid-range PC configuration. Just keep in mind that ray tracing and path tracing are very demanding and are not essential for great visuals. You’ll still enjoy the game without them.

All things considered, I would definitely recommend playing Cyberpunk, especially if you really enjoy futuristic sci-fi themes.",True
1091500,Great story line and amazing graphics.,True
1091500,Great game great story great character writing great graphics and great scenes,True

big improvements since the release game ,when i pre-orded the games and mods do wonders to this game 
",True
1091500,"Peak story. Cyberpunk 2077 pulls you right into Night City with its compelling stories, memorable characters, and the cinematic approach it uses for cutscenes. By the end, you'll find yourself emotionally invested in the fate of your character and those around you, all struggling to find their own version of a happy ending in a world stripped of hope.

Johnny Silverhand: ""A happy ending? For folks like us? Wrong city, wrong people.""",True
1091500,"Great game, love the graphics, mods are a great option!",True
1091500,"A few minor bugs, but a really good single player fighting / shooting game. Reminds me of Far Cry in the open world sort of sense, but more borderlands with the guns & the RPG of Skyrim / Fallout. Even before I downloading some QOL mods (mainly fixing car driving lol) it was a blast. I may be glazing a bit, but I'm 1. Glad I waited so long to try it and 2. Glad it got the polish it deserved. 

I did kind a rush through one storyline and I was surprised by that, luckily it warns you, so I saved before I proceeded. Theres a LOT to do.",True
1091500,Solid game ;3,True
1091500,It is a very good story but the ending could have been better.....,True
1091500,"Still the best world building/atmosphere in 2025. I can't believe it's been so long.

City of dreams, city of nightmares. This game was and is an epiphany that changed my life.

What is legacy, and why do we mortal humans strive for it so, on this pale blue dot, adrift in the void?

Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty answer all of those questions, IMO, and more, with wonder, panache and writing that delivers like a freight train through the soul at times. 10/10, just great, even after such a rocky launch at the height of the pandemic. See you on the flip-side, chooms! ^_^",True
1091500,"Amazing game, great story line. recommended 100%",True
1091500,the best story i have ever played im about to start my 3rd run.,True
1091500,"Great game. Story is pretty good. Combat can get repetitive once you see enough of it, but mods keep making the game fresh. My only wish is that there was more to the world. Seems it could be more",True
1091500,"I actually enjoyed myself with this game, the bugs and load times were annoying there and now, the gameplay is good but made better with some modding, I think the main draw in was the world and it's characters, this maybe the very 1st game at least for me where our own main created character is really interesting, many feelings and many moods, but what a ride to the end that was.",True
1091500,"Very fun post all the bugs, some occasional crashes but honestly it runs extremely well. I have enjoyed the variety of game play styles you can do.",True
1091500,"I love this game so much. 
I played it years ago when it first came out and even though it was pretty much unfinished and buggy. I still enjoyed the story and the characters so much. Of course now years later it’s so so much better. And experiencing this story and its depth all over again is just as good of an experience. The story *chefs kiss*
The characters so good. Highly recommend if you want a deep, somewhat emotional story.",True
1091500,"I can't really describe how much I adore this game... Hundreds of hours in night city and all of that felt like barely any time at all. I don't think I'll ever forget this game, it's something beautiful, something that will never fade",True
1091500,"This Game sucked at the release, But it has gotten so much better",True
1091500,very very good game. rich beautiful world. 10/10 companion anime.,True
1091500,"This is by far the most impactful, beautiful, and well made game i have ever had the pleasure of playing. The story made me weep, the game play had me still thinking about it months after finishing because of its excelling complexity and breadth. The underlying exploration of corporate hellscapes, unfettered capitalism, and the nature of the soul was not only deeply moving but a breath of fresh air in our massively propagandized world. Every new discovery was a pleasure and I cannot thank the developers enough for delivering this labor of absolute love to the world, i can feel it every time i plat. Every story in Night City is a tragedy, but that is never really the end, and that has never been the point.",True
1091500,"On release the game was awful, a few years later and its easily one of my favourites. I try to make a new character 1-2 times a year. Very fun and an amazing story.",True
1091500,"I can't believe I put over 50 hours into this game and am now recommending it. This game was announced in 2013 and a gameplay demo was shown back in 2018 that had me so hyped. Unfortunately, we all know how that story went and the Cyberpunk we were left with is still surprising, really good. Sure I can see a lot of depth and granularity missing compared to those earlier demonstrations. But I think Cyberpunk 2077 is a great foundation to be built on for the sequel. Hopefully just next time they can land the delivery without overpromising.",True
1091500,"Played the full game, plus DLC, and almost all endings. - starting from the Streets.
If you heard things about this game having issues, know that in my experience, there are very few bugs and they were just funny, it is very polished, and very much feels like a finished game.

This game is one of my favourites. It looks stunning, the combat I chose was a ninja, which was fast and fluid (if not a bit OP), focusing on Speed, Stealth and Blade abilities. I could become invisible, slow down time, then jump and slash large groups of enemies rapidly before they knew what hit them.

The story was decent, but with how many missions there are and how broken up it is, it is easy to forget what the last thing that happened was. It is possible to play through a path of missions without breaking them up, but it isn't natural because they often require a passage of time between them, which can only be skipped by going to an apartment to sleep that time away.

I definately recommend this game to people, but know that this isn't a game with many choices like I thought it was going to be. Saying no to a mission just means that mission will be sitting waiting for you to change your mind. Almost all decisions of importance are at the end. It is a lot like most AAA games, but it has some brilliant characters and blade combat that made every moment worthwhile.

- Story Spoiler -
[spoiler] One story and set of characters did really stand out for me though - Judy and Evelyn. The writing and voice acting was sublime, I really cared about Evelyn and was heartbroken by her story. But Judy is so perfectly my type it threw me, I've never experienced a connection like that in a game, it was very interesting! I worked so hard to get an ending where she would be with me, and nearly thought I had made a mistake, then I saw her waiting and I was so happy! Thank you for providing me with a nice send-off. [/spoiler]

PS I very nearly missed my perfect ending because I didn't go to my apartment to sleep. So make sure to sleep!",True
1091500,"A game I was initially so hyped for, just for that excitement to be ruined on launch. 5 years later I'm back and it is everything I wanted and more. It really is the most immersive video game I have ever played. DLSS4, RTX HDR, Hardcore/QOL/No HUD mods. It is next level. Bravo CDPR and the modding community. Bravo.",True
1091500,"This game is amazing, so much fun to play with just the right amount of challenge. sure it still has a few bugs but in time those will be fixed too. 10 out of 10 definitely recommend.",True
1091500,"One of my favorite games of all time. The IMMENSE vibes in this game are absolutely unmatched and is exactly  what cyberpunk/dystopian fanatics want. The soundtrack is one of the best ever created that enhances the immersive visuals and style that is present along the whole journey. Every corner of the map is an artistic masterpiece that will leave you thinking about this game for the rest of your life. 
Another big W about this game is the many different combat styles you can specialize in, making it possible to heavily customize your play style ranging from a gun specialist to an katana wielding killing machine to a netrunner that can hack its way through any situation. 

Oh and...a HUGE W for including elements from the amazing Cyberpunk Edgerunners anime. I love to see the appreciation that the game shows by including the OST and various items from the show. Everything about this world is top tier entertainment!",True
1091500,"Despite the early bugs and set backs, this game rocks, and the endings are meaningful I suspect I will be playing mods on this game for sometime to come.",True
1091500,"tldr; game is great with less bugs than a standard bethesda game, if that's all you wanna know then you can stop reading.

now where do i even start? The main story is quite short, but it's written in a way where it nudges you toward questlines that are filled with characters and stories that have the ability to make you feel, feel disgust, feel sadness, feel remorse for the choices you make along the way, but more importantly, make you feel connected and attached to the world and the characters in it.

Night City is a world of it's own filled with struggling families, psychotic gangs and corporations that want to bleed you drier than the Saharan desert, but there are also people who wan't the world to change, and they're willing to act for it too if they can just get a little push from a friendly merc along the way.

After completing the game the first time I felt a bit melancholic but also hopeful for V's future, Then i played through the other endings and felt sad, this was not because the endings were written badly but rather because in Night City you're lucky to even live to see another day.

And last but not least, my thoughts after playing through phantom liberty and all it's endings are best summarized by a saying from the Far Cry series ""Sometimes it’s best to leave well enough alone"".

Preem game chooms, had a blast and i'll miss Night City. maybe i'll come back some day but for now it's time for goodbyes.",True
1091500,"Now that it has settled down, this is a pretty fun game.  Not terribly hard and the inventory management is a bit confusing.  Story seem great.  I can sit down for an hour here and there which I like.  I'll finish it eventually.",True
1091500,"great game, like a  futuristic gta and a great story behind it, especially with the spinoff series, as well as all the iconic items.",True
1091500,The game is huge and very well developed. There is so much details that are unique. This game is even better than GTA.,True
1091500,"Amazing graphics, amazing gameplay, very immersive",True
1091500,Very good game fixed lots of the bugs,True
1091500,It's a work of art after all the updates. If you want to have feelings in a video game this is the one.,True
1091500,"It is a beautiful game, the visuals are stunning. The story line options for the most part are great, your life path that you chose at the beginning really only affects the first 20 minutes of your game play. Though can affect some dialogue options. If you are considering getting the game it is most certainly worth it!",True
1091500,"One of if not the most immersive and engrossing RPG experiences I've had. World building, music, level design, and especially gameplay all have so much passion.",True
1091500,"Really beautiful game— visually, thematically, narratively, and technically. It's extremely polished now, and feels amazing to play. The sheer scope of this game's world and the amount of (usually dangerous) nooks & crannies V can get lost in can sometimes be overwhelming, but it's absolutely worth it to take the time and really explore the map rather than just drive from place to place never really taking anything in. The combat system has surprising depth! I was particularly impressed by the stealth mechanics, but there are so many different approaches you can take. It's just so satisfying experiencing the progression of a build and feeling V becoming more and more of a terrifying presence with each gig. The story and characters though are where this game really shines. V's desperate struggle to survive in such a hostile, bleak world is a deeply profound and relatable one. The more you experience it, the more you will begin to understand why the people that V encounters, even the filthiest scumbags and bastards, operate in the way that they do. And yes, Phantom Liberty is an extraordinary expansion that REALLY explores this dynamic and tests both you and V's limits in regards to it, making it a definitive part of the Cyberpunk 2077 experience.

Night City is a monster that wants to eat both you and V alive, but you'll both find reasons to stick around no matter what. For me, it was the thrilling combat, the provocative storytelling, and the cast of characters of varying degrees of moral bankruptcy. One of my new favorite games of all time. Now's as good a time as any to finally dive in, or back in if you tried to play at release and decided to let this one sit on the back burner until it was more stable.",True
1091500,"A game redemption story, worthy of a recommendation. 
A no man sky like story for CDPR, enjoying the game so far. Looking forward to finishing it.",True
1091500,"I didn't play this game on launch, so this is an unbiased review about how the game is now.

Insane amount of content in this game. This is a polished, high-end RPG. It's not particularly choice-driven in the dialogue, but it's a joy to immerse yourself in.

The cyberware is cool but I would have loved them to go further. The power fantasy feels stifled. I have fortified ankles and can do super jumps and tank rockets to the face, but I die if I fall more than about ten metres - that takes me out of the experience every time. Moving into the next game I would love for them to go further in the power fantasy and cyberware aspect. Let me leap higher, run faster, pick up and throw cars at the very high end of things - the kind of things you'd see in Edgerunners, or Prototype. 

The story is great and I think threads a pretty great line between the story it's trying to tell, and the choices the player is allowed to make. This is definitely more of a linear story that you can affect, but when you have characters like Johnny Silverhand so deeply involved in your own story, it's really carried. The NPCs and their believable personalities really make the game.

It's lucky that the missions are such high quality and that there are so many of them, because the sandbox part of the game is actually pretty barebones. I mean, the city is spectacular and hugely detailed, but street-level NPCs aren't really driven by much. There aren't really any systems that allow for any kind of emergent gameplay. You have the GTA stars system, you can fight MaxTac, that's pretty cool. You can buy cars, steal cars ... that's about it. You can't rob stores, there aren't really any 'activities' out in the world that aren't tied directly to missions. Crafting is there, and it does its job without becoming tedious, which I appreciate.

I will say that of the missions, there is a nice mix between longer involved missions, and shorter tasks like eliminating cyberpsychos or responding to NCPD crimes. The generous amount of the latter really makes up for the lack of other open world content. The story missions are great but some of them take actual hours to complete, and it'd be great if there were more of a heads up about which missions those were. Phantom Liberty teases a new area, but doesn't tell you that the introductory mission is about 4 hours of linear content during which time you're locked in. Would be great if I knew what I was getting into.

CDPR clearly focused more on the bespoke content, and since there's so much of it, I can't fault them at all. Next game I would love to see more systems-driven and emergent stuff, and better cyberware ... but if the game is simply more of the same, I'll still be happy.",True
1091500,one of the best games i have ever played & with mods this game is so dominating.,True
1091500,All time redemption story only maybe topped by No Man's Sky. One of my most played games in the last five years (mostly on PS5) and the 2.0 update made it even better in every facet.,True
1091500,"if you like to feel immersed, you wanna feel like a bad ass and feel the dynamic story around you? in a world where your choices, engagement, and upbringing of your character plays a tangible roll on the games story telling? play this game i'm gonna keep it a stack its easily one of the best games ever made.",True
1091500,"I feel fat, fuck megacorps, rockerboys will never die.

Probably one of my favorite games of all time, great characters, amazing DLC, and a very good story. The amount of critical decision making in this game makes it feel genuine and does what a ton of roleplay games fail at (IM TALKING ABOUT YOU FALLOUT 4.) which is making the player actually like the characters, nothing in this game feels empty when it comes to the characters, I found myself really enjoying character dialog with nearly every character in the game, I felt like the choices I made actually mattered, like they had actual impact. And not only that, but the use of a protagonist that is essentially a blank-slate allows for a plethora of head-cannons and playstyles.

Overall Cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece, and what all roleplaying games should strive to be.

",True
1091500,"Just buy it. Excellent characters, world-building, story, gameplay, graphics... honestly nothing to hate other than the fact that it ends. Great replayability too; there's plenty of choices to make as you go through the story.",True
1091500,"I cannot say this enough - this is the single best gaming experience I have ever had. Without spoiling anything, let me just say this; this game feels lonely. Lonely in the sense that you are in a sea of people, and you do not matter. And you are saying this as one of the most powerful, influential mercs in Night City. You can only imagine how the average person in NC feels. And it's entirely immersive - the city waits for nobody, especially not a corporate hellscape like Night City. You either keep up, or you're swallowed up by the tide. Throughout the game, you are consistently reminded of that by the worldbuilding.

I don't have much else to say, this is just one of those games that you just HAVE to experience yourself; one review, or even a thousand reviews isn't going to cut it. The voice acting is among the best I've seen in any game; so much so that a friend of mine thought that I was watching an anime. Graphics are a no-brainer; among the best as well, and after many years, finally optimized. 

Can't wait for Cyberpunk Orion.",True
1091500,"Superb Game.
Lots of the initial release date issues resolved.

1091500,So much better now its been updated since release great game,True
1091500,"Genuinely one of the best games I've ever played. And that's not a meme.

The game is massive, and the world is huge in both complexity and world building, going through the backstory and the shards detailing the world post datakrash is amazing, and the complexity of the characters you meet and hear about in terms of legends amazes me

The gameplay loop is incredibly enjoyable, with varied ways of handling a problem, personally this latest run I've been playing as a net runner, and I've had so much fun I haven't put the game down.

It was buggy at launch, it still has its hiccups, but it's absolutely feature rich, bugs are relatively minor and I've not had anything game breaking at all.

I cannot recommend this game enough, it is a journey, I have laughed, cried & sat in anger at this game and it's world. It's an emotional rollercoaster under the guise of an action RPG. A perverse mirror in which consumerism and technology reign supreme. A stark warning and gratuitous parody. I love it.",True
1091500,this game is fun though if you have enough money instead buy gta and if you dont like gta and you like this more buy the game.,True
1091500,"Epic gameplay, huge world. The bugs are still there but it's worth it.",True
1091500,Looks stunning and feels awesome to play when your build starts to take off but god damn there are WAY too many interactable cutscene and dialogue sections frontloaded into the main story.,True
1091500,CDPR Put in a lot of effort to make this game what it is now. Give it a play and you won't be disappointed.,True
1091500,"I waited a long time to play Cyberpunk because I heard how bad the bugs and crashes were when it was first released, totally different game, superb storyline amazing graphics so fun to play",True
1091500,"Unfortunately as it usually happens open world games, main story is incredible forced farce trying to gaslight player instantly from moment when prologue ends and actual game opens up. 
It's best to take main story as lies told by unreliable narration by completely ignoring or go against what ever it pushes, when ever possible.

Meanwhile side quest and important characters met throughout playthru on journey are far more interesting as usual. Making wonder was it really worth it ruin original story that was being made pre 2018 with massive change that got us mess that was released unfinished 2020 and then patched for years. 

Too many Cooks in the kitchen.

On side note
Ironically this runs far better on Linux Mint than it did ever on windows 10 without crashing.",True

2.0 was released a year ago and just now I'm 31 Hours in my first real playthrough

This game deserves a second chance even tho the launch was an absolute disaster. 
Consider the DLC even tho I haven't played it yet but have heard it is an absolute banger

And I'm still playing it
Writing quality all over the place, mod support shaky, updates are often disappointing by introducing new bugs rather then fixing old ones
And I'm still playing it
The game has the interest in story development to appeal to fans of FO:NV and capacity for action that will appeal to Serious Sam fans without forcing either down your throat, and that's why I'll probably keep playing this imperfect kluge of a game for quite a while yet.

The story is engaging - featuring great characters and choices.

The game looks amazing, the characters are interesting and well written, the quests have surprisingly good variety and complexity, the mechanics and itemization give you endless possibilities for the type of build you want to play (especiallly since you can respec perks for free).

there's a lot to do besides the main story, different kinds of builds to play with (melee, stealth, tank, etc.), multiple endings, and even secondary missions are interesting so don't skip them!

1091500,"Oh que celui-là va être difficile.
Je suis très partagé entre mettre un non recommandé très sévère à cause du fait que, même plusieurs années et de multiples patchs après la sortie, le jeu ne tient toujours pas ses promesses d'origine; et mettre un recommandé enthousiaste parce que je me suis quand même bien éclaté pendant plus de 100 heures et que je compte bien y rejouer à un moment.
J'imagine qu'il est plus honnête d'évaluer le jeu qui existe pour ce qu'il est plutôt que le jeu qui n'existe pas pour ce qu'il aurait pu être. Du coup...

Cyberpunk 2077 est un RPG très orienté action à la première personne dans lequel vous incarnez V, le (ou la, mais je vais tout faire au masculin à défaut d'avoir du neutre) mercenaire le plus malchanceux de Night City, et pourtant y'en a de la concurrence. Suite à une mission beaucoup trop ambitieuse pendant laquelle il n'a vraiment pas de bol, V va se retrouver avec dans la tête une copie 1:1 du rocker/terroriste/anarchiste/egomaniac Johnny Silverhand, menant a une collaboration forcée des plus houleuses face aux megacorps d'un futur dystopique pas si lointain. Gros kiff.

Je vais passer assez rapidement sur le gameplay parce que même s'il est cool et dynamique, ce n'est à mon sens pas la force principale du jeu. Cyberpunk 2077 étant un vrai RPG pur et dur, y'a des levels, des stats, des arbres de talents liés à ces stats et une progression verticale des plus vertigineuse qui va faire passer V de victime du quartier à machine de guerre immortelle capable d'annihiler des bataillons entiers de soldats d'élite en quelques secondes à peine. Cette progression est renforcée par la possibilité d'upgrade le personnage avec du cyberware offrant des avantages variés, du double saut à la capacité de ralentir le temps pendant quelques secondes en passant par les lames planquées dans les avants-bras ou encore la possibilité de résister à un coup fatal en regagnant de la vie à la place.
Les possibilités de builds sont nombreuses, les playstyles variés, et que vous soyez du genre à vouloir tout exploser au machinegun, à vous la jouer full weeb en courant partout avec un katana ou encore à embrasser le délire netrunner à fond pour faire un perso totalement basé sur le hacking, vous trouverez votre compte et le jeu fait vraiment en sorte que tous les styles soient funs à jouer. Là dessus, c'est vraiment réussi.
On déplorera possiblement que le jeu ne va pas assez loin dans certains délires pourtant très présents dans le ttrpg (et oui, Cyberpunk est avant tout un jeu de rôle papier) comme les body mods complètement absurde ou encore la possibilité de devenir full borg. En même temps, ""Le jeu aurait pu aller plus loin"" est un peu la critique principale que j'aurais à lui faire, sur quasiment tous les aspects.

Ca suffit pour le gameplay, passons à ce qui selon moi est [b]la[/b] principale force du jeu, la raison pour laquelle j'y ai passé plus de 100 heures et que je vais y revenir, ce qui m'a fait acheter le jeu en premier lieu: l'ambiance et la promesse d'écriture.
Witcher 3 m'avait déjà mis une grosse claque avec Novigrad, que je considère encore aujourd'hui une des villes les plus réussies dans un jeu vidéo. C'était grand, ça faisait vrai, mon immersion était totale. Night City, c'est ça, en mieux (si on exclu les NPCs qui font des allers-retours sur les passages piétons parce que leur routine dure 7 secondes).
Un aspect que je recherche particulièrement dans les RPGs, c'est leur capacité à m'immerger dans un univers qui est radicalement différent du mien. C'est bien simple, aucun jeu n'a aussi bien réussi que Cyberpunk sur ce point là. Que ce soient l'ambiance visuelle, l'identité forte des différents quartiers, les slangs omniprésents créés spécifiquement pour le jeu, les pubs beaucoup trop fortes partout dans les rues, les dingueries qui arrivent au pif et donnent lieu à des quêtes secondaires impromptues, TOUT participe à une immersion permanente et donne au jeu une cohérence et une identité propre. On est propulsé dans cet univers si proche et pourtant si éloigné du nôtre, tout paraît si familier mais est pourtant si différent. Je ne pourrais jamais insister assez sur la prouesse accomplie en terme de worldbuilding. Jamais je n'avais aussi rapidement accepté un univers.
D'habitude je me dis ""Oh c'est marrant/sympa/curieux comme manière de faire"" en voyant une utilisation inhabituelle de magie ou une technologie fictive, je remarque la manière dont les créateurs ont intégré au quotidien les éléments uniques de leur monde. Ici je n'ai pas remarqué, j'ai adopté. Les technologies fictives m'ont semblé naturelles, et ce n'est qu'après coup, après avoir arrêté de jouer, que j'y ai pensé plus activement.
Là Ou Le Jeu Aurait Pu Aller Plus Loin(TM), c'est sur le plan moral. J'aurais aimé être plus dépaysé et être mis en face d'un spectre moral beaucoup plus gris où toutes les nuances finissent par se mélanger. Night City est censé être cet enfer dystopique dans lequel personne ne peut rester blanc. Tout le monde devrait avoir des squelettes dans le placard, et j'ai trop eu l'impression de croiser des NPCs sur la morale desquels moi, depuis le confort de ma chaise et mon emploi stable, pouvais m'aligner.

Pour suivre dans cette ligne de pensée, j'ai globalement trouvé le jeu trop propre. Alors oui y'a un peu de gore, y'a un peu de NSFW, mais ça reste vachement en surface. Encore une fois, Night City est censé pousser le délire de la débauche et de la corruption à fond, et tout est bien trop sage. J'aurais aimé, quitte à ce que ce soit une option qu'on puisse activer/désactiver selon les sensibilités, que l'aspect ""capitalisme débridé sans retenu qui en fait toujours trop"" soit plus présent. En 2020 (et quelque) on peut pas me vendre un yaourt ou un parfum sans que la moitié des gens présents dans la pub soient à poil, alors pourquoi le futur sombre où Amazon et Nestlé dirigent le monde fait preuve de plus de retenue? Un jeu appelé CyberPUNK devrait plus me bousculer et plus oser.
Vous vous souvenez de la scène du Petit Batard dans Witcher 3? Je m'attendais à ressentir ce niveau d'inconfort beaucoup plus fréquemment dans Cyberpunk 2077. Surtout avec le tuto qui, pour le coup, fait vraiment le taf et fait une promesse en terme d'ambiance et d'atmosphère qui n'est malheureusement pas assez tenue.

Globalement, mon ressenti de Cyberpunk 2077 est que c'est un bon jeu, qui aurait pu être tellement mieux. Ce qui est dans le jeu est bon, l'écriture est bonne, les dialogues sont bons, les personnages sont bons, le gameplay est bon, mais ce qui n'est PAS dans le jeu me manque tellement que j'ai du mal à pleinement apprécier ce qui y est.
""Les gens ne voient pas les détails, ils remarquent l'absence de détail"" (Shun Geek) est une phrase qui m'est restée en tête depuis que je l'ai entendue. A ce niveau d'ambition et de production, ce sont vraiment les détails qui font la différence entre un bon jeu et un excellent jeu. Et ce sont les détails qui manquent à Cyberpunk. Ce sont les choses inutiles et donc indispensables. Les choses dont les jeux comme Red Dead Redemption 2 sont absolument truffés et qui témoignent d'un soin apporté que je ne retrouve tout simplement pas ici.",True
1091500,"Es verdad Cyberpunk 2077 no es el juego que nos prometieron,  cuando se anunció pensé que sería un revolucionario juego, en todos los aspectos,  algo nunca antes visto , un antes y un despues , pero la realidad , es que un juego con unas mecánicas ya vistas,  y que juegos como GTA 5 que se lanzó mucho antes que  Cyberpunk, contiene más detalles en su mundo abierto , que en el mundo abierto de Cyberpunk 2077, pero entonces qué es lo que hace tan especial Cyberpunk para haberse convertido en un juego tan aclamado? , la respuesta es, por  su historia , los Cd Projekt saben contar historias , saben de personajes, las misiones son tan interesantes , que no sabes si es una principal o secundaria, te invitan a realizarla  todas, no te obligan, y te hacen vivir una interesante y genial historia , en una ciudad que gráficamente  se ve genial, por eso recomiendo este juego , por su historia ,  su Game Play esta muy bien, pero su fuerte es su historia , recomendado  8.5/ 10",True
1091500,"Great game, has an excellent combat loop",True
1091500,"Played during launch on a Xbox Series X, and enjoyed even with the bugs, but the current level of polish of this game is insane!",True
1091500,"Got this game since its launch, so glad to see the game is in a fun and playable state.
Gunplay feels smooth, melee fun, driving is good too tho i probably shouldn't have a license.
The story I got lost in it for hours and it makes me want to re-play it over and over.
Highly recommend Cyberpunk, game is hella nova.",True
1091500,"This game had a rough start, but its development was way harder than anyone could have imagined. After all this time, I finally got to experience it, and I completely connected with it.

One thing that really stood out to me was how your decisions and chosen abilities affect how people react to you and how the world changes around you. This level of immersion makes Night City feel truly alive and dynamic.

With the latest updates and Phantom Liberty, the game has not only redeemed itself but has become one of the best RPG experiences out there. Enemy AI has improved, combat feels better, and choices have even more impact on the story.

🔹 Stunning graphics and RTX lighting make the cyberpunk world feel real.
🔹 Deep and memorable characters and storytelling (especially Johnny Silverhand, played by Keanu Reeves!).
🔹 The music and atmosphere are incredibly immersive, especially when driving through Night City.

 Bottom line: Don’t miss this! If you haven’t played it yet, now is the best time!",True
1091500,"[h3] Iconic game [/h3]
The game is an example of how modern games should be: great story, gameplay, and visuals. It took me a few hours to get comfortable, but it was all worth it. I enjoyed every minute played. Even side quests are well-thought-through, hence deep and interesting. Leave alone the main story and the DLC, which are simply spectacular. Technically, the game is ready: it looks great, no bugs. If you haven't played this masterpiece of the gaming industry, you definitely should. Recommended.",True
1091500,"This game is an experience !!! Had a rocky start at first but couple of patches in and the game becomes a whole other beast. The breathtaking but a shit hole of a city awaits with a amazing story that would leave you dead inside. Trust me when I say, once you immerse yourself into it, Night City with all of it's beauty and flaws would feel like you are right at home. Highly recommend you pick this up along with one of the best expansions you could ever play. 

So grab your iron and take the fight to Corpos choom !!!",True

1091500,"Okay, yes, it lives up to the hype. What an amazing and immersive game! I actually hated it the first night of playing (I'm not a fan of FP/FPS), but once I got used to the controls, mechanics, and specifics of the game, I fell deeply in love. The story is amazing, DO NOT give up before you get through Act 1, I hear way too many people doing that! About 10 hours in I knew this was going to be in my top 3 games of all time. Beautiful masterpiece...so much fun.",True
1091500,"Uh this is pretty good. Graphics are pretty. The city is immersive. It has enough variety to bite into and feel like you got your money's worth. Honestly it doesn't get much better for gaming in 2025, with how terrible 98% of games are these days.",True
1091500,"This game is the most redeemed game since launch. At First a huge fuck up, and now it's fixed and even better than ever after phantom liberty. Fun story and characters and mostly very good gameplay.",True

1091500,I have been really fond of the game overall. It's very fun and compelling. It has a great story and a variety of playstyles to specialise into and a fairly detailed open world to explore.,True
1091500,"absolutely amazing sandbox/world. i have installed every mod i can to make combat interesting in this game. i have not found a way to make combat enjoying/challenging. i dont find video games to have interesting story, maybe the best i can think of is a souls game, but that is because they are vague and force you to imagine your own story. the world/graphics carried this game for me for 30+ hrs. if you like witcher3/rdr2 i assume you would like this game. for me i'm putting it down before coming to the conclusion because the story doesn't interest me.",True
1091500,"good things to those who wait. the release was shameful but i just played for the first time as week ago and yea, def recomend. its not thee craziest, best, mot perfect game ever. but its VERY good and the first game i've really felt immersed in, which isn't something i usually play for but really enjoyed here. i constantly find myself just driving around (in first person) going with traffic just thinking as if this is real life. 
 I will say though i don't think they should have moved on to a sequel i think they could have added more and smoothed out this game. but i guess take what you learned and move forward?",True
1091500,"First played the game on release. Played again after patch 2.2 with the DLC, and honestly very surprised by the improvements and bug fixes. It feels much more refined now, with all the gameplay mechanics working, and only few crashes during the final phantom liberty mission. Overall, very satisfied and will definitely recommend.",True
1091500,"The game has made a complete 180 degree change from its original launch. Granted, I first tried to play on a pS4 and now have a modern gaming computer but the game runs so much better. The experience is way more immersive. if you haven't played since launch you have to give it another try.",True
1091500,amazing gameplay and graphics,True

""Quiet life or Blaze of Glory?",True
1091500,"As an older man now, sticking to a game after playing a couple of hours and wanting to come back to it is rare. Not the case with this game. It's soooo good and after I'm done playing it, it's stays on my mind. Cyberpunk is a mature game and also a very fun game. The story so far is great and I can't wait to keep playing it :)",True
1091500,"Cyberpunk has definitely climbed its way up to being one of my all-time favorite games! I really enjoy how TTRPGs are coming to life in video games these days, and the graphics in this one really enhance the whole experience. Plus, I’m a huge fan of open-world games! If you love a captivating story full of twists and turns, along with plenty of action and adventure, I’d highly recommend giving it a try!",True

1091500,"Cyberpunk had a terrible launch, full of problems and bugs, disappointing fans of CD Projekt Red. However, playing it a year after release showed significant improvement, though it was still just average.
The game truly transformed with the 2.0 patch and DLC, earning the redemption it deserved. Playing it again after these updates revealed Cyberpunk as the incredible game it should have been from the start, with the DLC's story standing out as exceptional.
I will likely play it again, as it's an experience worth revisiting.",True
1091500,"only game to ever make me absolutely sob at the ending, beautiful game and story and characters and the gameplay is so good too. cannot recommend hard enough",True
1091500,From what i hear the game was in a pretty ruff state on launch. But i can say that the game runs pretty well now in my opinion. There are a few minor bugs but nothing to stop you from enjoying the game and it's story. Would recommend anyone looking for something sink their time into check this game out.,True
1091500,"I can proudly say that this game has come a long way. Still might have a few bugs here and there but I still just find them entertaining. Played through the game on PC and on PS5 multiple times and I get to enjoy the experience every time. If you haven't tried this game yet I highly recommend it. Also, in my opinion the Phantom Liberty is even better than the base game story! Yes I have this game modded up on PC lol but I'm still enjoying it years later after it launched. Only regret is that I didnt review it sooner!",True
1091500,"Great story. Not your traditional FPS but it has it's merits. I like it because I like the genre. Much lore is not like the RPG but it is some what believable. One thing, Saburo Arasaka would be very old in 2077. In 2020 he was over 100 yrs old, so you do the math. Good story line for Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves). Again, he died in the nuke blast at Arasaka tower but it was good the story turned him into a construct in V. All in all I like it just disagree with the lore.",True
1091500,"Really good story, world, and characters. A little to easy, starts to feel like a bullet sponge game near the end.",True
1091500,God i love this game. Has to be one of the most best games out there. Really made me cry a bit at some parts. Just play the game for yourself and see.,True
1091500,its overall a pretty fun game the only downside is the bosses are garbage,True
1091500,"Only game I've played where every ending feels like losing a friend. 'There are no happy endings in Night City, not for people like us.'
Also looks amazing and side-quests never feel too repetitive and certainly never grindy.


Great game, will play again (and again)",True

Cyberpunk 2077 is an unforgettable experience that delivers on its promise of a stunning open world, deep storytelling, and engaging gameplay. Night City feels alive, filled with detail, personality, and endless possibilities. V’s journey, intertwined with Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves), offers a gripping narrative with meaningful choices and some of the best side quests in gaming.

The gameplay is dynamic, offering multiple playstyles—whether through combat, stealth, or hacking—while customization and cyberware upgrades enhance immersion. Despite a rocky launch, CD Projekt Red’s updates and Phantom Liberty expansion have transformed the game into a polished, must-play RPG.

Final Verdict: 9.5/10 – An incredible sci-fi adventure worth experiencing.",True

1091500,My favorite thing is running into a bug and wondering if it's a part of the game because it matches the scene.,True
1091500,Despite the rough start of the Cyberpunk launch they've completely changed the game into a once in a lifetime experience I highly recommend this game to anybody.,True
1091500,"With the help of mods, this game is finally at a point where I don't feel extraordinarily disappointed/ let down. back in 2020 I ended my play through with out finishing as I was so underwhelmed and over promised. with mods enabled this game is finally becoming the Sci-Fi blade runner style open world game I wanted.",True
1091500,"Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that does exactly what I expect from Bethesda games, except now, it doesn't have any of the jank. The combat is a breath of fresh air, it's fun to go into a enemy encounter and test out a variety of playstyles, you could hack and electricute enemies, you could have a mantis blade arm build to rip and tear them, you could pretend like it is doom eternal and go and fight guns a blazing, the sound effects are pretty killer I can't even lie, and the graphics are probably the best graphics I've seen in a videogame, and it's still relatively optimized, when I played this game with my RX 5700xt, I averaged around 60 fps at medium with some high settings, but with my 3080, I easily get around 110, keep in mind, the resolution is 1080p. DLSS and FSR are here, but they aren't required to run this game at an acceptable frame rate (cough cough Monster Hunter Wilds cough cough). The story is also really good, and has that signature intriguing CDPR flavour that will keep you on the edge of your seat, until the credits end, and the world building is stellar enough to keep you playing the game for extended periods of time, overall, it's a great experience, but I would recommend waiting for discounts as this game is nearly 5 years old.",True
1091500,"Amazing Story, fun side quest, and if you are coming to play this game after watching the Cyberpunk: Edgerunners anime I recommend doing the over the hedge quest to get David Martinez's jacket.",True

The story is captivating and immersive, keeping you hooked from start to finish. The DLC follow the same pattern neither too long nor too short, delivering a satisfying experience.

In short, if you love the Cyberpunk universe and want to develop your character while leaping from rooftop to rooftop in a thrilling narrative, this game is perfect for you. But let’s be real the sexual content is quite limited; it could have been more extensive. Also, female character models are a bit flat, but hey, mods let you upgrade with some silicone implant if that’s your thing. 😆 Oh, and the soundtrack? Absolutely phenomenal.",True

1091500,"When this game first came out, I was incredibly disappointed. I wanted to love it so badly because of the incredible story and atmosphere that I still forced myself to get every achievement in the game despite it constantly crash and bugging out. And now, after over 300 hours, I played the entire game from start to finish all over again and it was a completely different experience. The bugs are gone, the game never crashes, and it runs as smooth as silk. I honestly think that it is the greatest fps rpg on the market right now. If you've ever wanted to give Cyberpunk a try, now is the best time.",True
1091500,"Despite the orginal public rage(which turned me away at first) this game has been polished really nicely since. I will admit I was a bit cautious walking in at first but the game, graphics, and audio really suprised me. I will not lie when I say that this game has actually been remade anew. Worth every cent.",True
1091500,"2077 is playable and fun at base, but mods make it genuinely great. (And there are mod managers. So it's easy.)
My recommendation are rebalances. 2077s content is both plentiful and great, so you don't need mods for those, although they tend to be excellent.

8/10 without mods, with em 10/10. But, well, I made some of those, so bias ;D

he' mod support is great. Thanks CDPR.",True

1091500,"Played this on PS4 on release and it definitely had its issues. Replayed on PS5, and it was better. Now played it all through twice on PC. It was always worth it to me, even with the issues, but with the current updates (and the insane PC graphics) I cannot recommend the game enough. The storytelling is S-tier, gameplay is great, world is immersive. I'll definitely be playing it through again at some point.",True

1091500,"Hands down one of the best RPGs I've ever played, now that I've finished it I wanna play again, the story is rich and captivating, the characters are all well-written, each and every one is distinct, my man Viktor Vektor payed him back my debt as soon as I had all the eddies, Johnny Silverhand turned out to be a great fella in spite of the rough beginning. Gameplay wise I think it's hella fun thanks to all the modifications you can do to your body, and thanks to mods you can add even more variety. Talking about gameplay the stealth mechanic is broken you can crouch in front of the enemy and it will last a good 8 sec before you get noticed, even so I still preferred to kill them. Sometime the AI might be dumb or act sub-par to what you might expect but it did not bother me. Everything ran well, crashed once but it's fine, played the whole thing with rt maxed and it looked incredible. All in all it's a solid 10/10 in my books.",True
1091500,Played this at release and it was horrible but damn it came such a long way. Really intriguing story as well.,True
1091500,"One of the best games I have ever played. Choices you make are important. They changes the story and the outcome. The world is vibrant, rich and interesting to explore. Some small side quest can reveal a deep touching story or let you find an extraordinary stuff (weapon, improvements, etc). All of this creates quite an immersive experience.",True
1091500,Was reluctant to play it at first but once the balls rolling its hard to put it down. 10/10 WOULD DEF RECOMMEND Its one of the best story's I have played in a long time and had me hooked and holding my breath till the end..,True
1091500,"Wow this game was amazing from both a visual aspect to the story.  The best RPG i've played and i've been playing for a long time.

Also in my entire play through the game only crashed one time and the performance was flawless on pc.",True
1091500,honestly i enjoy the side-gigs more then i do the actual main story,True
1091500,The game is still amazing. I never even experienced the game breaking issues people were complaining about but especially after all the updates and fixes the game is worth getting. Better make sure your pc is good enough to run it,True

Now comes bad parts game is as you would expect super high PC demands but if you can cover them it is amazing (not as bad as start but with that great story it is worth it) .

It was the best choice of my life when it comes to gaming, the pre 2.0 version was already a wonderful experience and the 2.0 version made the game feel like a complete and well rounded game. 
Absolute beauty of a game and an absolutely beautiful experience.",True

1091500,"This game is amazing. I am writing this directly after finishing the main story and just... god. This game is worth every single penny. This game made me laugh, cry, get angry, feel attached to characters like I've known them for years, and so much more. They've really worked past most if not all of the major bugs at this point, and at no point during my play through did i experience any game-breaking bugs besides one instance where path-finding a.i. kind of fucked up. Anyways, I highly, and i mean highly, recommend this game to anyone on the fence about it, so please, do yourself a favor, and have a preem ride in night city, choom.",True
1091500,"Years after its release and with continued support from CD Projekt Red, Cyberpunk 2077 remains a combination of impressive and deeply disappointing.

We were promised something more, and we had reason to believe CDP could deliver it. In-depth hacking, the freedom to play as any type of character, the ability to mold your own career as a runner to suit your play style and story taste. The truth is that even with 100+ mods made by a dedicated community, it still doesn't live up to what CDP made us expect.

It's still a great game. It has an engaging story, first of all. And some parts of the story can have radically different outcomes based on how you choose to deal with dialogue and how you complete the jobs. But the promise of emergent storytelling in the open world is not lived up to. Sure, there are a lot of cool details to be found around the world, conversations you can eavesdrop on, etc. But there is a huge missed opportunity of giving more personality to the gangs, involving yourself in their politics, having factions fighting each other (in other than scripted events), having reputation systems with various factions and fixers, and so on. Instead you get ""Street cred"", a single stat that unlocks basically everything, and that you can max really quickly because everything you do awards it and you can't lose it.

My recommendation for playing this game unmodded is to focus on the main story. Even the Very Hard difficulty will quickly become ridiculously easy (possibly with the exception of a few annoying scripted sequences) if you pick good perks and cyberware, so don't expect a tactical challenge.

The other option is to start modding, and if you've been there before, you know what kind of headaches you're going to have if you want to get it right. You can fix the main glaring flaws fairly quickly using NexusMods and their mod organiser Vortex, but if you want to start combining mods more carefully, the safest way is still manually installing them, which is a pain. Particularly because Steam's ridiculous policy to force you to update your games (well, the games they are kind enough to let you borrow), meaning you can't roll back to a functioning game version. (And this is why I am going to move to GOG for any games they have in the future.)

I enjoy the hell out of the story, and with the right mods Cyberpunk can become a shadow of what we dared to hope for when we listened to CDPR promote it all those years ago. Thumbs up, but if there's ever a sequel, I hope they have learned a lot and either don't oversell it, or actually spend all the time and resources required to make the game of our dreams. (Also, please aquire the Shadowrun license! :D )",True
1091500,"its a great game that looks visually amazing like genuinely top tier visuals and the gun play feels top notch and if you are able to get the dlc i would highly reccomend it cause so far it is absolutely amazing
",True
1091500,"Incredible game, in my top 3, and it's definitely not #3, its just a shame that the main story is so short. Great environment, great story, 10/10. More than worth the buy, especially if it is on sale.",True
1091500,"I was lucky enough to not have been interested in this game at release, so while I was aware of the state of the game at that time, I wasn't a victim to it.

This is one of the best games of ever made. Every character is three-dimensional and the decision to showcase slice-of-life type of missions with them was a great choice. By the end of it, you voluntarily chase side quests just to see storylines come to a close. 

I haven't played Phantom Liberty yet but I'll be damned if I don't.  Play this game.  It's worth $60 and then some.",True
1091500,"Great game, great graphics, great gun play.",True
1091500,"A masterpiece that keeps getting better!
Cyberpunk 2077 is hands down my favorite game of all time. The world of Night City is amazing, with wonderful depth, excellent stories, and an ambiance that makes it feel alive.

The RPG elements are rich, with various playstyles, impactful choices, and some of the best-written quests in gaming. The characters—Johnny Silverhand, Panam, and Judy especially—are iconic, and the story had me hooked from beginning to end.

The game has only gotten better since its release, with updates and expansions like Phantom Liberty enriching it, improving AI, and polishing mechanics. Whether you enjoy fast-paced combat, hacking, or just walking around the lively streets, there is never a shortage of things to do.

If you're a fan of open-world RPGs, you need to play Cyberpunk 2077. It's not just a game, it's an experience.",True
1091500,"A rocky cycle for Cyberpunk 2077 but it managed to crawl out the hole it dug itself at launch with meaning updates and cross media material like the Edgerunners anime. While its RPG mechanics aren’t necessarily the deepest, it excels when it comes to world immersion, story, gameplay etc. I’ve sunk a stupid amount of time into this game (beat it 4 times across platforms) and if a game can manage to get you to keep coming back the it’s a success that very few games ever achieve. Can’t wait for the next game.",True
1091500,"Next gen graphics, Next gen engine, Next gen development. Heart felt story, with alot of great gameplay and mechanics. Started off rough and everyone was quick to shit on it. now that it was polished everyone hopped on its dick. Love this game and HIGHLY recommend it",True
1091500,"Absolutely love this game. The graphics, the story. Can drive around for hours just in the open world. Best game I've played in a long time.",True
1091500,"It had a rough start but you know the quality is there unlike today's modern gaming, they just had small and short hiccup due to mismanagement and etc. Its like RDR2, it will grow on you after play it for awhile, and unlike RDR2, you will keep coming back to play this game, from the first basic start, to 3rd game start and so on with mods, then you learnt that NSFW mods exist and you just gotta play it all over again and experience the game with bigger quality.

So far there's no other game like Cyberpunk before, now and future, yet. So its basically makes you comes back to re-experience the moments with Jackie, the Night City escapade, and all the things that could had been, in a far dystopian, cyberpunk-ish futuristic saga game.

You can get out of Night City but you can never get the Night City out of you, and thats the wise words for street rats up to the corpos. Happy dystopian chooms!",True
1091500,"Obviously we all know that Cyberpunk 2077 started off at rocky start. Over time, CD Projekt Red put forth great effort and released a ton of updates/bug fixes that drastically improved performance and created a masterpiece. If this game had been released in the state it's currently in, I have no doubt it would go in the imaginary video game ""Hall of Fame.""

I played this game on and off for years, but never completed a full play-through. I figured it deserved a solid chance, so I put in the effort to achieve 100% completion for CyberSpunk 2077 and I wasn't disappointed at all. The stories are action packed and emotional, I caught myself tearing up a few times, and caught completely off guard at other times. 

The combat was so fun and exhilarating, the build variety is immense and customization. If you had hesitations about this game when it first came out, I'd give it another chance because the current state of this game is quite amazing <3",True
1091500,Not much else to say that hasn't already been said.  The game is a lot of fun and modding is so easy now that you can significantly change the gameplay.  A few mods loaded and all the enemies are upgraded from AI to their abilities and your 1-2 tapping instead of the standard rpg style shooter.  The game is great on its own and even better with the modders around,True
1091500,The characters had me hooked! Their love and agony. Hopes and fears. Absolutely has me hooked.,True
1091500,"This game is now what it was always meant to be. Strongly recommend it and its DLC, which is even better.",True
1091500,"Probably the most immersive game I've ever experienced. The detail is incredible. I especially enjoy how the soundtrack variety is curated and varied, making the songs feel like real songs you would hear in a futuristic setting. The game play is fun and you don't need to be a master at FPS to play, and the wide selection of difficulty settings makes it quite approachable for many audiences.

I enjoyed the story, but wish it was longer. It felt too brief.",True
1091500,"After playing this game for over 100 hours, the mechanical components of my laptop with 8gb of ram have molten and turned into a homogeneous paste. The heat from the device itself has left a burn on my table. I despite the lag on lowest graphics, i continue to play and im close to finishing the main story. I definitely recommend this game for anyone.",True
1091500,"As a huge fan of the Bladerunner universe, this game was heaven. To truly experience the art CD Projekt Red has but into Night City, you would need a beefy graphics card. But with path tracing turned on the and settings cranked to max, driving through a rainy night in the Night City listening to the radio is an experience unlike anything else in gaming. 

I played the game when it first came out; it was buggy, but not unplayable if you had a decently speced out PC. Playing it again in 2025 with the Phantom Liberty DLC is a whole new experience. The devs have definitely spent a lot of time and energy achieving what they set out for with this game. The combat is immersive, the story gripping and suspenseful, the world building is on a whole another level, and don't get me started on the music. 

This game is almost perfect, I'm going to be sad when I finish all the side missions knowing there's no more future content coming out for it.

Almost 2 playthroughs and 200 hours later, I can confidently say this game is a worth it at any price. It is one of the best video games every made.",True
1091500,"I got into this game after Edgerunners came out. I didn't know what to expect since i'm not a FPS type of player and iv never played a game like this one before. A big fan of the Cyberpunk Genre for years and Blade Runner is my favorite movie and man, this game hits all the highs to make this story line as unforgetable as that one. Highly recommend it to anyone who loves the Cyberpunk Genre.",True
1091500,"A master piece, unstable at times and requires some nice hardware to play, but it's worth it. A amazing dystopian setting, good comedy, good casting, good visuals, good story with many endings, etc etc. if you have some money to spare, pick up Cyberpunk 2077.",True
1091500,It may have had a rocky start but it is now simply one of the best games of all time and easily in my personal top 3. Its looks amazing and has a story that will surprise you with how much it makes you feel. It has immaculate vibes and great game play. It has me super excited for the Wicher 4.,True
1091500,"its fun. I liked playing it. The characters are well written and the environment is well designed. Its very good at making you feel cool and bad-ass. Gunplay feels really good, same with melee combat, not really driving, I think driving feels really bad. The actual story is mediocre and its creativity is kind of bad. There are a lot of cool concepts the game talks about but then kind of drops past the ""main story"" (braindances.), cyberware is kind of boring and so are the people who wear them, kind of like the cyberware in the TTRPG. Cyberware is really interesting (for me) because it allows people to look less human either for aesthetic or utilitarian purposes and it creates conversations about it, a lot of the people you see who have cyberware just look like normal people with metal, even some of maelstroms members are just normal guys with metal limbs and their whole thing is being modified beyond humanity. The game doesnt really offer you any philosophical concepts to think about outside of stuff like ""is killing people y/n"" or ""burn bright or stay dim"" (which it drops after the first act). Idk I think RED dropped the ball on a lot of the ""non-game"" aspects of this, its more punk (rebelling for the sake of rebelling) than cyber and the TTRPG shipped alongside this is kind of bad too. Its a good game though. I'm sure project Orion will be better. Its worth your money, I just dont think its the definitive cyberpunk experience.",True
1091500,"Cyberpunk has come a long way since launch.  I pre ordered it and then cancelled when I saw all of the bugs and instability that it had in 2020.  Coming back to it and getting all the achievements I had a great time playing through the main story and phantom liberty.  I became attached to some of the characters and found the whole experience to be quite immersive at times.  The unique combat abilities and vast amounts of weaponry really make killing enemies fun and engaging!  You have many different builds to choose from to fit your playstyle.  I will not spoil anything but I will say that you are in for many surprises at the end game.    On the flipside I did encounter some bugs that softlocked me at times and found myself at 60-70 frames in crowded areas on medium settings with a 3090 card.  All in all I definitely recommend this game if you are looking for a decent story and a ton of gameplay.  You have tons to do when you beat the game as well.  You definitely get your moneys worth!  Cheers to project red for listening to the community and for putting in the effort to make the game enjoyable and playable.  Overall I rate cyberpunk at 4/5!

",True
1091500,"Loved this game. The cyberpunk aesthetic is spot on—grim, dirty, and drenched in neon.

The story doesn’t hold back, and that’s what makes it so good. It feels real and doesn't fuck around which makes it full of moments that stick with you. And the DLC? Absolutely fucking incredible. 

",True
1091500,"One of the best games ive ever played, fantastic shooter RPG worth every moment.",True
1091500,I especially enjoyed the option to complete (most) content NON-VIOLENTLY!,True
1091500,"Great writing, music, voice acting, combat feels great and offers a lot of variety.",True
1091500,"This game is basically perfect, the storyline is great the characters great, I am so incredibly sad it had a bad launch and it made me not wanting to buy the game but after seeing the more recent reviews on the game being positive, I finally bought it, well worth the money.",True
1091500,"Don't let the low play time fool you. I have somewhere around 100 hours logged into this game on my PS5, both the base game and the Phantom Liberty expansion. Was the game a mess at launch? Yes. Is the game absolutely phenomenal now? Yes. Run, don't walk to Night City. 
",True
1091500,"With the DLC and the most recent updates for the game, I feel that it is fully complete and mostly bug-free. As a person who paid Full price for the game, I feel that I have received more enjoyment from this CDPR game than I did from most of the other games they produced. It's a blast to play through multiple times and on every difficulty.",True
1091500,"Good game, comeback story of the century",True
1091500,Amazing game. Amazing story. Amazing game.,True
1091500,"Unrecognisable as the game that released in 2020, the base game is amazing and i would be happy recommending it to anyone. The DLC however is in a league of its own and is one of the best things ive ever played",True
1091500,"Awesome game, at the start I was approaching it with lots of doubts but the more I played the more I sank more hours into the game. 10/10 would recommend to play at least once but the game has a lot of replayabilty value",True
1091500,"Outstanding, simply outstanding. I rarely play RPG's and gave this a dabble once v1.6 was released (i.e. when it became stable). Then it was excellent, since then it's become outstanding, to me at least. 793hrs play time, on my 4 full play-throughs, tried every starting path. Now on my 5th play-through with a 'New Game+' hacked save which lets me restart but with my V from the last play-through, on Very Hard, and boy-o-boy, new game entirely. Getting one-shotted, a lot, with a nearly max'd V on 'The Rescue' was quite entertaining!",True
1091500,"Man, I played on a pretty bad PC when it first came out. It forced me to use the lowest of low settings. I understand there were alot of issues for people but i didn't run into many because I made the game the equivalent of a potato. This made me not want to play past the 10 hour point even though i enjoyed myself. Many years and updates later I got to experience the game well past when I stopped on my garbage PC. This game is a must play for people into RPGs wanting to scratch that RPG itch most games nowadays dont give us.",True
1091500,"Still some bugs, but nothing gamebreaking, very enjoyable.",True
1091500,"Very immersive game play. And like other games I've enjoyed, Cyberpunk made me care about the characters in the game. That's something that even the best graphics and gimmicks can't do. For me anyway.",True
1091500,Cyberpunk 2077 has pulled a No Man's Sky and since release has improved and added to the game significantly. Today it's a great immersive RPG with some of the best graphics in gaming currently. Highly recommend if you're at all interested in the Cyberpunk genre.,True
1091500,"An incredible experience. The game feels alive, well writen characters, good pace and progression, extremely fun gameplay and combat. There are only a few downsides to the game, like non-competent skill progression, as some of the skills feels not to be as good as they should be, making you store skill points up to the point you reach higher levels. Even so, This work of art will be a mark in video game history, with a fantastic plot and a story capable of making you cry.",True
1091500,"The game with the worst launch but best final product. This is a game using the GTA formula to the greatest effect. Cyberpunk 2077 is a game with possibly the worst start of any game, ever. It has risen from the ashes of its disastrous start like a Phoenix: With an amazing story, fantastic characters, incredible graphics, awesome worldbuilding, & exciting gameplay, cyberpunk 2077 is probably the best thing to ever bottleneck my pc.",True
1091500,"Great game, excellent on all fronts really. Action, exploration, story, graphics, music, customization- it's all here.",True
1091500,Most fun I've had with an RPG in a while. Some bugs here and there but overall an S tier game.,True
1091500,good game. have 80 hours including xbox save. great story dlc is fire.,True
1091500,"fun story, even though some of the jobs feel repetitive they are still fun to just go around with the abilities and do your thing",True
1091500,"Fantastic game, saw that it could be good at launch but waited a few years to buy in order to wait for bugs to be ironed out. Game obviously shouldn't have been released in that state but it's whatever.  

V's journey is captivating, the gameplay (shooting mechanics, dialogue, setting) is great, and you get plenty of Johnny SIlverhand goodness. 

Never Fade Away",True
1091500,"This game on release was absolutely terrible, but after waiting a long time I tried it again.

An amazing storyline with an incredible cast of characters. I cried a shit ton at the end as well as the beginning (if you know you know).

The combat felt great but really wasn’t anything special. It was a looter shooter and that’s exactly what it felt like. Which wasn’t a bad thing.",True
1091500,"I originally played the game at release. I enjoyed it then, even with all the bugs and issues. But I just enjoyed it. I am currently playing it again and with all the updates this game is incredible. It is so much fun. There are things obviously I wish they had or added. But since release this game made a complete 180. Want to keep playing, start new builds with new combinations. This was how it should have been at release, and this just makes me excited for their next iteration, since they learned what they now need to do when making the next Cyberpunk game.",True
1091500,"Can't believe I didn't write a review for this game sooner, but I also haven't completed this game sooner.
Long story short, it's come a long way since launch, and it, along with the DLC (Phantom Liberty) are extremely atmospheric. It's a really fun game, with great lore, gorgeous graphics, and a lot of replayability! [spoiler] I just wish the endings were not as grim :P [/spoiler] but anyways, I thoroughly enjoyed it and I highly recommend it! Just... beware of being sucked in and becoming addicted lol, 'cause I was over here doing literally EVERYTHING in the game, reloading saves, replaying stories, etc. But that's a good thing :)",True
1091500,"Very good story telling, some bugs but still playable
",True
1091500,"Probably one of the few games that is open exploration that I enjoy immensely.

The story of the main questlines are okay, a few of them are extremely gimmicky but I'd much rather just go in guns blazing for sake of the fact its quicker and easier than just having to stealth around all the bloody time.

I mostly just enjoy doing the side quests, bumping into random events, and doing the NCPD assaults. It is simply insane just how much money and experience you can get doing that--and by the time I finished only two districts in Night City, I was already max Street Cred.

The game has a strong emphasis on 'play how you want to play' and doesn't really punish you that heavily.

Yes, the game has a Wanted system that functions almost identically to the one in GTA V but its actually leagues above and beyond in terms of quality compared to that one. How?

Let's observe how it functions in GTA V first--In GTA V when you get wanted levels, cops instantly know where you are and home in on you like missiles, they will actively hunt you down and even go into side alleys, above and below ground level, and will even use flying copters to track you down until the cops find you and kill you. The likelihood of getting away from the Cops in GTA V is very minimal unless you have every street memorized or having hiding spots planned ahead of time.

In Cyberpunk 2077, the Cops are lazy. If you literally just stay away from the roads, hide behind buildings or on rooftops or stay underground; the cops will literally get bored of trying to find you and go do something else. The Cops in this game, as well--also unlike in GTA V--are extremely weak. You can blaze through most NCPD units without much effort. Then they send in armored units which can be a bit tougher, but are manageable. But if you are truly determined to turn Night City into a Warzone you will have to contend with something that puts even the Military in GTA V to utter shame--MaxTac.

MaxTac are essentially mini-bosses that come in squadrons of 4 after you reach 5 Wanted stars and continue to become a pain in the city's butt. Depending on your own level, the difficulty, your gear and your setup you can either mow them down easily (keep in mind they are literal bloody hit point sinks) or they will blow you away within seconds. But if you manage to kill them, you do get a rare chance of obtaining some of their MaxTac gear, from what I understand.

All in all, this game by CDProjektRed is probably one of my most enjoyed experiences in the entirety of my time playing any computer game and even when I play the game overly-much and burn myself out and come back later? I can get right back into the groove of things because of one of THE best character systems I have EVER seen in a video game.

The Character Attributes and Perks system.

In this game, you have attributes which help you do most any kind of thing. Same with Perks, with assist with all manner of thing--both combat and non-combat.

Want to be a Bulldozer and just plow through everything with nothing but a baseball bat, and being so armored that nothing can take you down? Check.

Want to be that stealthy cyberninja that is able to throw daggers that can instantly down unalerted enemies, or use a silenced pistol in order to blow off the head of some gangster? Check.

Want to be the most powerful cyberhacker (netrunner) who is capable of detonating the car of a bunch of gangsters chasing after you? Check.

And that's not all--you are able to completely refund EVERY attribute and perk, for free, in order to try out a DIFFERENT build later so there is NO way to screw up your game by having invested into the wrong, crappy build.

I rarely feel this way about games lately, but to me? This game gets a bloody 10 out of 10. Perfect in every bloody way. THIS IS HOW YOU DESIGN A GOOD GAME, TRIPLE A PUBLISHERS AND DEVELOPERS. TAKE BLOODY NOTES!",True
1091500,"The 2.0 update made the game what it should have been from launch, and the DLC is some of the best in games. It took Pacifica from the place you meet the VDBs to the most in depth story, and best over-world interactions in the game. Much like older Fallout games do the side quest, and Fixer gigs that is were the game make NC fell alive.",True
1091500,"Amazing story, engaging gameplay and a lot of possible play styles that influence certain game mechanics.",True
1091500," 	Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the last few years you know how chaotic the release for this game was. Now I can confidently say that all that’s in the past. My first playthrough a few months after release had me underwhelmed and I just stopped midway through the game. But I recently played the Witcher 3 and enjoyed it enough so that I wanted to give Cyberpunk a second chance, and boy was I in for a good trip ! Most if not all bugs have been fixed, the balance and overall systems have been redone for the best and now the game is a real treat to play. 
 	Much like the Witcher 3’s Blood and Wine DLC, Phantom Liberty is a must, better than the base game in some ways and it offers the best missions, so make sure to get it along the base game. The best time to play it  - I find - is right before going to the point of no return.
 Additionally here are a few tips that made my playthrough more enjoyable :

- Cars are mostly fixed but motorcycles feel and drive much better, I went for the Yaiba Kusagani CT3X as soon as  I could afford it and stuck with it for the remainder of my playthrough.

-Night City is clearly the jewel of this game and probably the best city ever made for a video game, so don’t use fast travel and don’t skip rides as often as you can you’d be missing out on a lot of gorgeous places to just drive through.

-You can disable the annoying RPG hitpoints that spill out of enemies when you hit them, to get a more traditional FPS feel. Doing so doesn’t hinder you at any point and bosses still have a health bar. The game looks and feels much better that way IMO.

-Do all the gigs and side missions, they are nice.

-Phantom Liberty has the best gigs and side missions so get it !

1091500,It started out pretty rough but it has improved over the years and I can say that it's well worth the money. Great writing and soundtrack the characters are super fun and it's just really great in general.,True
1091500,"cant stress enough how much this game is the best game I played everything you do matters every choice will make you miss some part of story or experience said story, every little detail amazes me even in the world you will find random stories unrelated to any quest that will break your heart or leave you amazed just impressive however strongly suggest you play with the DLC as the polish and world building it gives seems necessary",True
1091500,"(I grant this game 9/10 Shards this game is nova!)

This game is so great i had to buy it for 80 Euro's after pirating it.
First off i had pirated this game as i was skeptical with its launch since i was waiting on this game for years. After getting close to the end i saw how great th9is game was after Phantom Liberty released and i bought it simply bringing over my savefile. The story is really fun and great, Characters have actual personality, Music that truly matches the universe , Fun weapon play, Diffrent playstyles with no locked in classes. DO i need to say more? No? Because i am going to say more the DLC enchances the game from about an 8/10 to a 9/10 it is simply that good with new locations in a large dangerous chunck off night city with sidequests and new variations off old things like criminal activity. The main game can feel shrt compared to other games yet the amount off voiced and rewarding sidequests its really great to walk around the world and do those.

1091500,"Very fun game, make sure that you have decent specs on your pc it can be a tad demanding to run. It can also be a bit buggy but nothing close to how it was on launch its much better now. I've crashed twice but other than that has been perfect.",True
1091500,"I have well over 100 hours on the game and on the way to doing all of the Phantom Liberty endings. I must say I'm a big fan of the DLC so far and the game has given me a motivation to try and collect most if not all achievements in both the base game and DLC.

Speaking out like most people, I do wish the romantic options had more depth. Especially when ""going on dates"" or ""hanging out"". It would be nice to have more cute interactions with Panam or Judy. Hell give me a DLC where I go on a virtual date with Johnny.
Definitely an improvement since release, highly replayable.",True

1091500,The story line and graphics are great. Phantom liberty likewise is a good addition.,True
1091500,"It's hard to wrap up all my thoughts about this game. I've completed all the endings, gained all the achievements, but I still get pulled back into playing this well crafted world. 

Playing this game is an other-worldly experience, one I wish I could experience new again. Night City is like a beautiful rose with thorns in every corner, with the permanent choices you have to make. I have never played a game with such immersive characters with exceptional voice acting, and an amazing story. 

Additionally, Phantom Liberty feels like a whole new game alone, the craftsmanship is incredible and I was amazed that this game could get any better. 

This is my favourite game of all time, and definitely the best story game I have ever played, and I can't wait for any future games CD PROJEKT RED release. I couldn't recommend this game enough, it is a work of art. But remember, there's no happy endings in Night City.

still considering to buy the dlc tho",True

1091500,"A great game to immerse yourself in, a capturing storyline and cinematics.",True
1091500,"I loooveeed this game until I got to the endings. I feel they are a bit lackluster and half of them are open ende. You are left wondering what actually happens + they are essentially the same ending you just take a different path to reach them. 
Other than that, the game is immersive and there's a lot of content and storylines if you like doing side missions. The combat is not dull either.",True
1091500,"What a long strange trip it has been.

When this game came out it was a buggy, awful mess. I have never been more dissapointed in a game. How that has changed...

After years of constant love from CD Projekt Red . Cyberpunk has redeemed itself to be one of the greatest games of the decade. It has joined The Witcher 3 in my list top 10 favourite games in all time.

Redemption is hard, but they have redeemed themselves.",True

1091500,10/10 game great way to pass the time on a daily it gets even better when you add mods.,True
1091500,"Okay. First off -> 90% of the bugs are features. The other 10%, for me, were; 1 CTD, 1 inability to pass ingame time without reloading, one inability to hang up the ingame phone without first reloading.

All the other bugs enhanced my exprerience.

Story, aces. Soundtrack, silly good. Characters, engrossing.

My only gripe is that the game is too big. At 266 hours for 57 achievements, the grind is painful. Legit, if you're an achievement whore like me, AVOID.

But for the rest of you, get out there, and stare at Panam's ass with the rest of us Cyberpunk loving degenerates.",True
1091500,"After All the Updates and DLC, best time to get in or back into Cyberpunk",True

Overall the Devs really polished this game.
And added even more features.
CD Projekt Red redeemed itself.  Hopefully they don't release wither 4 like they did this game.
Anyone who waited to experience this game years after its release made the right decision.",True
1091500,"This game doesn't rise to the quality standards of the Witcher III, but CDPR fixed it up a good bit since launch, and the world of Cyberpunk practically sells itself. I highly recommend picking up Phantom Liberty as well, since that really elevates the experience. Just don't expect a happy ending—those don't exist in this kind of setting.",True

This is the best game ever in my life
Every time i play this game it feels like i am really in there, forgotten realem!! It make me feel i was in there for real ㅋㅋㅋmaybe i’m addicted to this game!!! Recently after playing 500 hours i found very new point of fun that i have never felt before that mean i can play this game more over than 1000hours :) i’m so happy to play this game!",True
1086940,"I finally finished my first play-through, after 250 hours of gameplay :) It is the longest time I have dedicated on a game and I was satisfied each and every time I play the game. I loved playing Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance when I was a kid and I never thought I would ever feel the same with another game. This game brought me back to those times. Hours spent knowing the lore, talking to all characters, be it origin or NPC, exploring every nooks and crannies, looting even the most irrelevant resources... It really is a world of its own and I'm so happy to have been in it. This will most likely not be my last gameplay because there's still so much to discover. I have so much appreciation to the creators of this game. They really did an amazing job with this game. This will hold a special place in my memories.",True
1086940,"I mean, I could give you a big review about how this game is a great game with a great story and tons of stuff to do and all that crap. I can talk about how it is a buggy mess, where half of the ""features"" were only features because they couldn't fix it. How things like the Bulette are obviously bugged in ways that you wouldn't notice if you weren't paying attention. I could talk about how the ways you can handle problems are so expansive that, more often than not if you can think of a way to solve the problem within functions the game has, it will work. But really, anyone can watch a gameplay trailer, anyone can google bug reports. You really wanna know what I think of this game, and if I'd recommend it? Check my hours played.",True
1086940,"[b]Not a Fan of RPGs? This Game Will Change Your Mind[/b]

After a few sessions of [i]DnD[/i] (the tabletop game), I decided to check out the computer game based on its universe — [i]Baldur's Gate 3[/i]. And wow, it completely blew me away. The world feels alive and immersive, filled with rich characters and endless choices. The freedom to approach situations your way is incredible. From the stunning visuals to the deep combat and roleplaying, it’s clear this game was crafted with exceptional care and attention to detail.

This game is a must-play (especially fun in co-op). It’s a masterpiece that deserves all the love.",True
1086940,Prior to purchasing this I had no experience with tabletop; in fact I was hesitant to pick this game because it seemed overwhelming at first. Ultimately I'm grateful I decided to take the plunge. This game has so much personality and it really shows what a labor of love this game must have been to those who made it and it's made a deep impression on me. I don't think I can ever quite look at other games within the genre the same way now having played this. My only regret is that I can't rewind the clock to experience it for the first time again.,True
1086940,"Great game, worth every penny. I played through with my friends. We never did complete the final boss though. The third act had too many side-quests. We only care about killing first and then asking questions. Not really a critique though.",True
1086940,"If you even slightly like a well-written story, compelling characters, and RPG mechanics, just buy it.",True
1086940,"Just another Larian game with boring convoluted story and cringe humor. 
The combat is either too easy or a level-check and AI is braindead. Many enemies are buggy and spend their turns running back and forth or clipping through a ladder.
The world is very pretty but feels closed and dead, it is also full of empty jars, vases, urns and barrels which serve no purpose but to bait you or waste your time. Your avatar also climbs on every table to pick items which further slows the exploration down and brings unintentional comedy on par with the intentional quips of Larian.
There are choices, sure, but it is usually the old: Save the orphanage / Burn the orphanage with no nuance. Characters are forgettable pricks who insult you constantly and if you call them out, you have to kill them - boom - quest failed and whole location is hostile.

TLDR: It's still Larian.",False
1086940,I downloaded a mod that unlocked the number of party members and got EVERY SINGLE PLAYABLE CHARACTER in 1 TEAM. 10/10 Western Fire Emblem. Please don't sue me n*ntendo for mentioning you,True
1086940,"Amazing and rich story, with the most engaging, interesting, well written, well animated and well voice acted companions I've ever seen in a videogame. There is so much content that after playing for 500 hours, I’m still finding new stuff. Hell, the first time I finished the game I missed two companions and didn’t even notice. 

Just the companion quests are some of the best videogame content I've ever seen, and the game would be worth the price just for two of them.

At the time of this review, 7 major updates have been released, with an 8th one on the way. Each of these updates has improved the game (except for doors, those are still broken), its performance, and has added QoL improvements and content.

As an avid TTRPG player, this game has been the closest a videogame has come to providing the TTRPG experience. I can't think of a better compliment for a videogame, to be honest. The attention to detail is borderline insane, with such fringe scenarios that the devs have anticipated and made content for, that the many times it feels like a GM is there to run the game for you.

And the devs are just awesome and have released a toolkit that is allowing people to make mods that change core rules, add equipment and items, and even create whole new campaings. This move has probably cemented this game as the most long-lived videogame of the decade.

Baldur's Gate 3 has become my favourite videogame.
",True
1086940,"This is genuinely one of the most engaging games I have played in a long while. I typically don't like getting lost when trying to progress a story, but with Baldur's Gate there always something entertaining going on even in areas you never dreamed of entering. It makes every new playthrough feel unique even when you decide to make the same general choices.",True
1086940,"I was pretty enamored by the game initially, most likely from the nostalgia from playing BGII back in the day. I personally enjoyed building my character (as I tend to), but there are definitely some missing aspects that could help produce differentiation in characters. As with any game, there are some glitchy aspects here and there, but by and large fairly smooth playing. Each character has a fairly similar plot path, however. Choose glory or power vs. choose humility and inner strength, etc. All fine though. Favorite class by far (so far) has been the monk, way of the fist. I could see other classes pretty much had similar magical abilities (just differed on how to get there), so choosing one without any is what I recommend to folks looking for something different. I know that's a bit of a generalization, but hey... it's my review. A fine game. I hope they create some more diverse spell casting options that are more class specific though.",True
1086940,"Perfect. I have never played an RPG to this extent, over 1500 hours now and I honestly still love this game. The combat, the writing and the characters are 10/10. My only downside to this amazing game is now I find all other RPG'S boring in comparison.",True
1086940,"Have you ever looked at games that won a mountain of awards and thought, ""Aww come on, some of those have to be bought, or they did the right industry handshake."" Put such cynicism aside and believe when I say Larian crafted ANOTHER absolutely incredible RPG experience. Every award and accolade is earned, every actor gave spectacular performances, and Larian has spent so much time post release adding everything from QOL changes to additional free content to community mod support. BG3 is a fantastic game, a work of art, and proof that devs who love the project and the community can deliver, in a massive and resounding success.",True
1086940,"Sometimes you have this mood ""I'm going to re-play Dragon Age Origins for the nth time!"". Now it's going to be Baldur's Gate 3 instead of Dragon Age Origins for years.",True
1086940,"What an amazing game, what an amazing adventure. Now that I've reached the end, with many nerve-wracking battles behind me, I'm sad that it's over. I'll miss it..miss my companions, the characters and the magical world around Baldur's Gate..Thank you to the creators of the game, what a unique job you've done",True
1086940,"There aren't many games made these days that are designed for player enjoyment. This is one of them, it is well designed. The dialogue is great! There is a ton of clickables, different scenes based on different choices, the loot makes sense.... just literally made well in every way. 
Makes me look at sims and wonder wtf... why do I even buy you.",True
1086940,Originally i was turned off by the Dungeons and dragons/Forgotten realms genre because i believed it was just played by exceedingly nerdy 30 year olds that didn't shower.....I still believe that but they make a pretty wicked Rpg series and with exceptional storytelling.,True

1086940,"[h1]This is a lovely game. However, Divinity: Original Sin 2 had better player interface. Let me explain:[/h1]

[h2]THE PRO'S[/h2]
[h3]I love the world of DND. It's a great fantasy world, and this game reflects it really well:[/h3]
[list]
[*]Classes and races mesh well;
[*]Skills and abilities are usually useful and can turn the tide of battle;
[*]Every upgrade that adds to your primary stats, and damage output, is meaningful;
[*]Your narrative choices are reflected through the campaign;
[/list]

[h2]THE CON'S[/h2]
[h3]As I mentioned before, there are some peculiar things that should be better. Those mainly boil down to a few particular issues:[/h3]
[list]
[*]How come am I able to melee attack thin air?
In a turn-based battle, i have wasted numerous turns, because i have misclicked my mouse (or the game does not register that my mouse hovers over an enemy), when i have an attack selected.
There is no reason why this should be in the game. By default, this should only happen when i press a modifier hotkey to allow attacks at thin air.
[*]How come am I attacking a structure, but not moving behind it, by default?
I have had few battles started because i wanted to move behind some object which has HP (such as wooden structures).
Clicking on such object, by default means that i either want to INTERACT or WALK AROUND.
There's even a hotkey to attack. Why is it in the game, if, without having it pressed down, my character attacks things that provoke conflicts?
[*]Walkable areas are not marked clearly, and while that in itself is not an issue, i should be able to ckeck, if an AOE fire spell will cover the entire passage between me and the enemy, or not.
[*]As I said, these are usually not an issue in D:OS2. In that game, attack is not the default action. You have to trigger it by holding down a hotkey, else your character would simply do whatever is considered the second prioritised action in BG3. Additionally, there is a hotkey to highlight walkable area, so that you could use the knowledge the game has, as intended.
[/list]
[h3]I do realise that my conplaints are probably only unique to me. however I do have them, and for a review, they should be voiced[/h3]",True
1086940,"Great game. Your choices actually matter, and boy do you get to make choices. Tons of different options for most encounters. Great graphics. The rest system is a little dated and annoying, and I thought the game was actually a little too long.",True
1086940,"A great game for those who want an RPG tabletop game experience on the virtual. 

The story is immersive, the characters have distinct personalities and motivations for the players to explore, and the array of options on how to proceed your adventure is just impressive.

The gameplay is a delight from dialog to exploration and combat.

Highly recomend this experience, be it in solo play or with friends.",True
1086940,"Amazing RPG, probably the best since Dragon Age: Origins. Some awesome things were obviously cut, especially towards the 3rd act of the game where it feels rushed and not as amazing and open ended as the 1st and 2nd acts, but still great, especially the end. I'd give it a solid 9/10, easily. Sucks Larian, Biowares spiritual successor imo, has opted not to make DLC for it or a sequel, they would have my money! Not sure I would trust anyone else, please don't hand it off to Bioware especially! Thanks Larian!",True
1086940,"I was hesitant to buy this game because I've never played DnD, and so I thought there would be a big barrier to learning/understanding the gameplay. I finally caved and, while there is a slight learning curve, the game has overall exceeded my expectations. It just feels like a more accessible way to engage in a traditionally tabletop RPG, and I've loved pretty much everything so far (only about halfway through act one). I also recommend playing with your friends if you get a chance and you all can handle the cost, as its definitely more fun when nothing goes to plan! :p",True
1086940,Great game.  There's so many different ways to play that multiple play through's are a must,True
1086940,"This game, I have yet to finish, and yet it is one of my favorites. The world is beautiful. The music is beautiful. The characters are beautiful. The voice acting is beautiful. The story is beautiful. The biggest disappointment about this game is how there isn't going to be more games like this thanks to Hasbro's greed and idiocy.",True
1086940,This game should be the industry standard for games with massive development budgets. Nothing else even comes close to how polished this game is in basically every aspect. Larian studio is one of the few larger developers/publishers that continue to deliver good games when the rest of the AAA market has been on life support for years.,True
1086940,"Play time is misleading as this game is so great I've bought it four times on three different platforms, one of the greatest games ever made and I will gladly die on that hill",True
1086940,"The amount of content this game has? It's amazing, and the characters are hella engaging- I can't wait to progress further!",True
1086940,"Haven't finished the game yet, but I played enough to solidify my opinion on it. Baldur's Gate 3 is a great game that is a bit held back by the DnD 5e mechanics. 

I won't spend too much time singing praises since BG3 broke into the mainstream and it was very well-deserved. Larian Studios had already proved they could make an amazing CRPG with Divinity: Original Sin 2 and with the extra time they put into this game, their mastery shows. A lot of stuff to do, fun quests and dungeons, interesting characters to interact, great voice acting and good improvements from the TTRPG version of the mechanics. If you're looking for a fun, high-fantasy, tactical combat RPG with a lot of dialogue choices, go for it.

My two main complaints are with the multiplayer and the DnD 5e combat/progression mechanics. 

Regarding the multiplayer, I think it's mostly my preferences. There are clear improvements in comparison to DOS2 multiplayer in general, but I still feel like this is a game I'd rather enjoy on multiplayer co-op, while it's clearly designed with single-player in mind. You can still have a lot of fun with it, but it will make you miss out on a lot of the character-driven narratives and the general self-insertion story that these RPGs tend to aim for. Once again, I wouldn't say that that is necessarily bad, but it clashes with the way I prefer to play - and you can always play with each player using an origin character from the game.

Regarding the DnD mechanics, I think it's a straight downgrade from DOS2. Leveling up only in your class by default, action types instead of action points, daily and level up spell memorizing and all that, not fun in my book. These adaptations from DnD 5e add complexity that doesn't add tactical depth on one end and restrict choices and freedom on the other. Like I said, a lot of good changes from the TTRPG mechanics were made, but it's still a flawed system for me. 

In conclusion, I very much do reccomend Baldur's Gate 3. I think it's more polished and approachable than DOS 2 (even though the general mechanics are less fun, in my opinion) and deserves all the praise it has gotten. It's an awesome RPG adventure and clearly worth the price.",True
1086940,"This game is incredible...
I am inexperienced with proper D&D tabletop games, but I've always wanted to give it a try. I know this is somewhat different since you have saves you can load if you don't get an outcome you want, cause video game, but I find part of the fun for me is getting to play through this campaign over and over to experience the different paths and endings as you want to. No shame to people who don't want to save scum though, you live dangerously and I respect that, and I think this game is probably still rewarding to those who don't.

That aside, Larian really cooked with this, and are STILL in the kitchen even long after it's release. 
The game of the year award was so well deserved for this masterpiece. Everything from the visuals, to the gameplay, to the characters + character customisation and the classes, to the music, and even to the changelog and community update posts (your humour in them is fantastic and  so on-brand, thank you for hiring whoever it is that does those). This is the work of a games studio who actually care about the individual game they and their employees put great amount of efforts into being an enjoyable experience and playable even beyond a single year from it's release date. Not saying they are the only one's to do it, as there are plenty of other games out there that have achieved this feat, but rarely does it seem to apply to the vast majority of games that big game studios seem to churn out these days.

Even though my luck on rolls sucks when playing through this game at times, and I am an idiot who is still learning a lot of things about certain aspects (thank you ""load save"" feature for these reasons in particular lol), I still just struggle to put into exact words how good this game is and how strongly I recommend this to anyone who has taken even the slightest bit of interest in this game and are unsure on whether to play or not. We are well over a year out from the game being released, so I would like to think most people have by now, but if you haven't, please do. I promise it will be worth your time. This game will reward you tenfold.
Good luck, soldier!

1086940,I'm sure I don't have to describe why this game is good. It deserves all the praise it has gotten. I have to give a shout out to the mod support though. The mod menu makes it very easy to download and manage mods. It might be the best mod support I have seen. It also means that I can have every character in my party at once and I can romance everyone. Yes it does break the game. Yes it is worth it.,True
1086940,"If you love RPG games and still haven't played BG3 you are really missing out.  It is a fantastic game with many different ways to replay the game and still get different outcomes.  Tons of fantastic achievements to earn.  Most of the characters are likable and have moving story arcs. You will laugh, you will cry, you will stare flabbergasted at what just happened, and you will cheer.

I didn't know it would be the perfect game for me when I bought it, but I saw that it's from the D&D realm and that sealed the deal for me.  I'm now on my third playthrough and about 380 hours and don't plan on quitting any time soon!

Their backstories, their incredible voice acting, the variety of outcomes, are all just amazing beyond my ability to easily express in a format like this. 

This is one of those games where, were it not for the incredible replayability, I would feel empty for a while. The quest was accomplished. The story is over, and the characters all are going their own way, no longer united by purpose. The Fellowship is dissolved. 

But this is one of those games where the end isn't really *the* end. Rather, it's just one end. There are more to be seen, and now I have to go back and see what else there is. Maybe it's time to try this Dark Urge everyone is talking about.",True

Update: I won the fight after like 6 hours of trying, and even then I just switched to easy difficulty to be able to win barely. Was a good fight tho, worth it.

Update 2: I am still struggling every fight on easy mode and I have come to the conclusion that it is a skill issue and I have under 10 IQ.",True
1086940,"Zesty aah vampire.

It's pretty good, but the main story  and plot is hardcoded and essentially always follows the same path, regardless of your choices. Replayability loses almost all value after about 3-5 playthroughs unless you use mods, but even then those can only enhance or add to what's already there, they can't change much of the game itself. For me it's maybe an 8/10, would go straight to 10/10 with a map editor, because then this game just becomes DND: The Game. 
People able to make their own campaigns, rig the triggers, tags, and put in their own sounds and voice acting. It would be an extreme amount of effort to make a good BG3 campaign, but I imagine all the official DND 5e staples would be recreated in record time. 
The idea of a different campaign in even half as much of scale as the main game's campaign, maybe with the DND 5e ruleset mod, let alone multiple, just seems like such an insanely good idea that I'm peeved we don't have it yet.",True

1086940,"Super fun and good looking game despite all the.... weird stuff and messaging for MODERN AUDIENCES.

Every character being a sexually ambiguous 5LU7 is something I could do without.

My biggest complaint is the rejection of Forgotten Realms canon, as if the writers truly hate the sourcebooks. Example: Tieflings and celestials are rare, and the prospect of many of them finding one another and creating a thriving breeding community is ridiculous even for a high fantasy game set in the realms. And they don't all have red skin and scales. Basically the whole tiefling refugees thing was such a cringe and unnecessary thing trying to force a parallel with modern global politics.

This may be a gripe with 5e and not the game itself, but truly concerning is the disappearance of moral good and evil, being replaced with arbitrary ""consequences"" of good and evil acts. In the real world AND any fantasy world we are allowed to roleplay within, our choices aren't just guided by our selfish desire for certain future results. ""I won't kill this person because if I do I will miss out on the chance to purchase goods from them in a later act"" isn't how civilized humans make decisions. Everyone knows there is good, and there is evil, and to pretend they don't exist reveals a very bad agenda from the development team. Bad for everyone, whether it's a kid playing for the story or a group of friends playing for the lolz. Either way the pretense that good and evil don't exist, only legal and social consequences, leads to a very watered down and sterile gaming experience. If I do murder, I want the game to treat me like a murderer. If I stop murder from happening, I want the game to treat me like a hero. This game seems to obfuscate both so that no matter what you do, nothing really happens and everything is just this grey area of excuses.",True
1086940,"Absolutely peak, I well and truly adore this game, every class is fun and does something different to the others. There are also ridiculous and strong interactions created by different items, the challenge runs reflect this; you can beat the game by throwing underwear, just walking, through mocking your enemies, as a cat, etc. The game gives you choices other games wouldn't and always rewards exploration, the amount of effort that has been put into this game is unparalleled. It also now has mod support too; the community is already making whole new campaigns, classes, items, and more. Very very good game, don't miss this one unless you detest CRPGs or dice-based games.

1086940," [h1]Baldur's Gate first playthrough review [/h1]
 [h2] A one in a lifetime experience[/h2] 

Baldur's Gate 3 is my first in a lot of case
1. Its my first ever CRPG
2. My first ever over the top CRPG
3. First D&D style game

Going into this game I had a lot of reservations, there was never any doubt that this is a once in generation game and the best this genre has ever seen. The question was, is this game for me. I was skeptical even through the mindflare section, it was o out of place for someone who has played and been in love with third person action since childhood. I have spent countless hours in RPGs but this seemed too complicated to start. Controlling four characters seemed convoluted, but I was in a quest. 

My quest to complete all the GOTYs I had missed over the years and Baldur's Gate seemed too much of a challenge to take on. I am glad my stubborn mind pushed through these inhibitions. I am proud of myself for pushing through as Baldur's Gate 3 first playthrough will probably be one of the best gaming experiences in my life. My only regret would be I wont be be able to experience ""first"" playthrough ever again. When the credits roll BG3 left me with a sense of gloom that I probably didnt experience before. Its a unique feeling that I hope more people should experience the ""first"" time. I genuinely and truly believe that the reception and global appeal this game has received doesnt do enough justice to the absurd feat that Larian Studios has pulled off and I am thankful to them for giving me something to cherish for the rest of my life. 

",True
1086940,"This is almost completely subjective; the game has a legit claim on the title of greatest RPG ever made. I just don't like it.

There are so many decisions in this game that bother me. I play tabletop RPGs for real, I don't need to watch virtual dice rolls. I don't like the constant narrator endlessly droning on about everything. There's a ton of other things I really dislike in this game, a lot of it baggage with modern D&D.

Shit, why isn't Karlach in the damn cover art?

You hear endless tales of people doing crazy shit, juggling people off cliffs or throwing cursed fish or whatever, the game ""let's you do anything you want"". I played a necromancer and 90% of dead people have absolutely nothing to say. the remaining 10% have nothing to say I can't already figure out. I'm not expecting full dialogue trees from every body in the game, even from the insane detail of this game, but it would have been nice to find a stash of loot or something now and then.

Never seen an RPG world with this much depth and verticallity, rather than flat planes with cliffs and plateaus. I dreaded the game being full of exploding barrels and that tactics revolved around ""throw shit at things"", but there's so many things that interact in different ways along with solid movement and ability use. 

The characters are damn amazing. Why isn't Karlach on the cover? I want a mod to have everyone in the party at once so nobody gets left behind. It's a real pity Asterion doesn't seem to have any real plot until the end of the game, when everyone else gets real moments to shine. It's really damn disappointing that Alfira seems like she should have been the bard character but her role in the game is to get butchered by the Dark Urge. And yeah, looks like NOT playing the Dark Urge was the chump option, you've played the game incorrectly if you didn't pick it or an origin companion. Dragonborn are so awesome looking it's basically a crime none appear until Act 3.

Act three is messy. Buggiest part of the game. The only major crash I had happened there and forced me to replay a long, complex encounter. The narrator crapped out and went silent which actually didn't bother me too much.

And after 170 something hours of a campaign, I finished the game and basically got the modern equivalent of ""You get Win!"". I made a heroic sacrifice, watched a companion die, saw Withers basically laugh at the previous games, and then credits rolled before being dumped to the main menu. So the worst bug I encountered was apparently ""lol, no ending for you"", which is pretty fucking devastating.

I'm so glad I'm finally done with the game and can stop playing it. I'll probably start another game in the future. I'm very much torn between love and hate with this game which unfortunately averages out to ""just knock it off already, dammit"" most of the time.",False
1086940,"What I expected: A vampire dating sim.

What I got: A genuinely incredible, story and character-rich, lovingly-made D&D campaign with themes of [spoiler]abuse and manipulation[/spoiler], and overcoming trauma and becoming better for it. And all that in addition to a vampire dating sim.

",True
1086940,Everything I could have asked for from an RPG. Larian hit this one out of the park. Every time I play it I find something new and approach solving situations in a different way. One of the best video game purchases I've ever made.,True
1086940,"This game does not live up to the hype.  It's long, drawn out, and it has plenty of QOL issues.  Sure, they spent a lot of money and time on the in-game animations and dialog, but as a fan of other CRPGs that rely more on text I found it a bit boring.  My biggest pet peeve though was the cap at level 12.  I literally played the last quarter of the game at the level cap.  The extra XP I received could have easily led me to level 18.

Overall I'd give it a 3 our of 5.  It doesn't reach the level of the original games or games like Pillars of Eternity.  But if you find it on sale, sure give it a go.  Don't pay full price.",False
1086940,"Now... there's subjective reasons for me not recomending this game, and there's quite a few objective reasons as well.

Subjective ones:
1; The story never really clicked with me, which makes it really hard to put up with the kinda slow and clunky gameplay. I usually don't have an issue with gameplay similar to this, and I prefer turnbased combat if possible. But turns can take a very long time in this game, and outside of a few gimmicks you can pull off (that are staple for Larian, and I already got tired of in D:OS2), every combat ends up feeling very samey. Without a story to keep my engagement the game just felt like a slog.

2; I found most of the companions to be annoying and/or not interesting at all. My favorite would probably be Gale... but the writing is so juvenile that he tries to get into my pants after 1-2 days of adventuring. I don't mind romance in games, or even sex scenes, but if they're this shallow it just feels like the developers are going ""We know what you're here for! Here you go! Just pick whatever character you want to do the dirty with and talk with them a little bit!""

Objective reasons:
1; The camera is god awful. It gets stuck in the terrain more often then not. Sometimes refuses to look inside buildings even tho my characters are already inside said building. And sometime it just spazzes out completely, flies of in a random direction and just get stuck at max distance and doing this terrible shaking. Not to mention that you can't look up, at least I've found no way of doing this. Something you'd think would be important in a game that puts a big focus on verticality, but no, you have to stand in certain specific spots for the camera to zoom out and let you see that, yes, there's a platform here you could jump to.

2; Bugs and glitches galore. I would have assumed most of the common bugs would have been ironed out by now, but seems Larian doesn't agree. I've lost count of how many times some of my characters have just started floating in mid air, as if standing on some invisible extra floor a bit of the ground, no longer being able to interact with anything because it's ""out of reach"". A save and reload usually fixed the issue, sometimes I had to reload a previous save. However, it's a very annoying thing when it happens so frequently. 

There's also been multiple occasions where I've told a character to attack a door/barricade, and they instead just end up on the other side of it. Not the biggest of issues perhaps, unless the thing I was going to destroy would have spawned the actual entrance to another area, and it can't be attacked from the other side... just reload a save I guess. 

The game seems to be trying to make me savescum, no matter if I want to or not.",False
1086940,"One of the best games I've ever played. Loads of customization, deep and dynamic characters, and fun combat.

And furthermore, the people in charge forbade them from cramming the game with anything whose only purpose was to increase revenue and didn't serve the game design. They didn't treat their developers like numbers on a spreadsheet. They didn't treat their players as users to exploit. And they didn't make decisions they knew were shortsighted in function of a bonus or politics.

They knew that if you put the game and the team first, the revenue will follow. They were driven by idealism and wanted players to have fun. And they realized that if the developers didn't have fun, nobody was going to have any fun.

I absolutely love the usage of things like dice rolls and how they impact story event outcomes and even minor dialogue. Excellent game overall but the maturity rating is something that parents should really pay attention to considering graphic game options that can be toggled on & off, use of ""fowl"" language here & there, and generally adult geared themes.

1086940,"Initially, when I started playing Baldur's Gate 3, my experience was surprisingly underwhelming. The complexity of the game's mechanics, overwhelming dialogues, and intricate combat system felt daunting, making my first impressions somewhat negative. I wasn't immediately drawn into its vast world or captivated by its storytelling, which felt slow-paced at first. However, everything changed dramatically once I began playing with friends.

Teaming up transformed my entire perception of Baldur's Gate 3. What initially seemed tedious suddenly became immensely entertaining. Coordinating strategies, laughing at unexpected outcomes, and exploring the richly detailed environments together created an experience unlike any other. The multiplayer aspect significantly elevated the gameplay, adding a sense of camaraderie, unpredictability, and shared adventure that truly brought the game's expansive content to life.

One of Baldur's Gate 3's standout features is its deep and rewarding combat system. Every encounter feels unique, requiring thoughtful strategies, careful positioning, and clever use of spells and abilities. Playing with friends makes these battles even more enjoyable as cooperation becomes essential. Strategizing together to overcome challenging enemies or hilarious failures due to miscommunication makes each session memorable.

Beyond combat, Baldur's Gate 3 offers an incredibly immersive storytelling experience. The characters are beautifully crafted, with rich backstories, meaningful interactions, and impactful decisions that resonate deeply. Each choice has tangible consequences, shaping the narrative uniquely with every playthrough. Completing the game twice, totaling over 350 hours, I discovered new story arcs, secrets, and character interactions, highlighting the game's astonishing replayability and depth.

Visually, the game is a masterpiece, filled with lush environments, detailed character models, and stunning magical effects. The world feels alive and expansive, enticing exploration at every turn. Accompanied by an exceptional musical score, the audio-visual experience perfectly complements the narrative and gameplay, immersing players fully into the Forgotten Realms.

In conclusion, although my initial encounter with Baldur's Gate 3 was less than ideal, sticking with it and experiencing the game alongside friends completely changed my opinion. Its deep gameplay mechanics, immersive storytelling, exceptional visuals, and unparalleled multiplayer experience make it one of the most rewarding RPGs I've ever played. Whether you're a fan of the genre or exploring RPGs for the first time, Baldur's Gate 3 deserves your time and patience. Dive in with friends, and you'll discover a profoundly rewarding and endlessly entertaining adventure.

Great story, so many tiny details that make every run different- you can play as your own OC, each race providing a different experience, or play as an origin character. I find it very fun playing as origin characters because it gives a new perspective of the game and each person has a small bit of new content.

And the massive amount of re-playability in this game and the huge amount of content with great voice acting all around, and on top of that a co-op experience that is surprisingly good for this type of game. You can easily lose thousands of hours to this game.",True
1086940,"Not enough words to express how amazing this game is. From the story, to the setting, the story and its characters, all spectacular. Just get it and try it. It recently won the well-earned title Game of the Year.

The story is gripping and will keep you engaged throughout the three acts of the game. Each choice you make in the game has a direct or indirect impact in some way as you progress the story which I loved and made me contemplate every decision I made. The main story is an amazing and emotional journey with the conclusion of it being satisfying but also wanting more at the same time. The story is compelling and constantly kept me up at night till the AMs to find out what happens next. Moreover, your party companions and the side characters all have interesting back stories and quests to follow along your journey. 

This game had a spectacular cast of characters. All characters including minor to major NPCs were well-voiced acted and professional mo-capped which added to the immersion and the emotional impact of story events. 
This game had one the best stories I have experienced and I wish I could play it again for the first time.

This is my first experience with a CRPG and I loved it. Furthermore, the gameplay is directly inspired by Dungeons and Dragons which I had little experience of, but after a learning curve, I have grown to love it. Everything is decided by a roll of dice which is fun, difficult (in a good way) and strategic. I have always had a love for turn-based games and this game does in a way that I was not used to but it pushed me to learn and be engaged in every way.

Dialogue is even decided by dice, which can be frustrating at times but the game can be very forgiving, giving you ways to buff or re-try your rolls for important story moments.

Graphics of BG3 were not industry-leading or anything like that but it is still quite beautiful. The world and its each region was well-detailed and immersive. Performance can be inconsistent, there are times where actions can lag after a couple seconds particularly in Act 3. In my first play-through I did run into major performance issues in Act 3 which made it pretty much unplayable, then a week later Larian Studios released Patch 5 which fixed most of the issues which made the performance in Act 3 become passable. 

I now understand the hype of BG3 and the fact that it won GOTY. I strongly everyone to play this game if you love RPGs or have curiosity on it following the game winning GOTY.",True

1086940,"Baldur's Gate 3 is a triumph in modern RPGs, offering a captivating blend of narrative depth, strategic gameplay, and visual splendor. The story is both complex and immersive, with morally ambiguous choices that shape the world and your character's journey. The combat system is strategically rich, allowing for diverse approaches and rewarding tactical planning. With stunning visuals and a diverse cast of characters, each with their own backstories and motivations, Baldur's Gate 3 delivers a truly immersive and unforgettable experience.",True

Fantastic storyline, character development, you can dictate how you want to play the game (good aligned, evil, goofy, chaotic), you can get creative with your builds, and character customization, and they've graciously integrated mods into the game which has and will continue to keep people coming back time and time again (including me). Romances are thoughtful and for a mature audience - some games are a bit too childish for me and It makes if difficult to resonate with the story. BG3 literally has something for everyone.",True

1086940,"This is hands down one of the best games I've ever played. I put off playing it for so long because I REALLY dislike turn-based combat, but I was pleasantly surprised to find it was actually really fun & well done in BG3. The character interactions feel genuine. The characters have their own agency, even going so far as breaking up with you if you do something they don't agree with and leaving the party. The voice acting & motion capture is phenomenal. Decisions from Act 1 have overarching stories that follow you all the way to act 3. There's nuance to decisions where there isn't a cut and dry right or wrong situation and I love that morally grey aspect so much. Their environmental story telling had me ugly crying in the arcane tower. I have never seen a studio care about a game like Larian does. The actors were all offered intimacy coordinators for romance scenes, they listen to their fanbase and take those critiques into consideration for the next patch; even something as small as a random NPC saying something like ""What, am I going to pull a chicken out of my skirt?"" but she was wearing pants and in patch 7, they gave her a skirt. Their attention to detail is unmatched. I cannot recommend this game enough, it's so good.",True

 Despite loving the old original Baldur's gate games, this one initially didn't appeal to me. The characters, talking to animals, etc. The price tag.

1086940,"I enjoyed this game more than I ever thought I would. Played through with a group of friends, and then simultaneously started two other playthroughs. The replayability is incredible. If you enjoyed the choose-your-own-adventure style that many of us Millenial-aged readers did, I imagine you will love this game as much as I do.",True
1086940,"This is the best game I have played in a long time. Every penny spent is worth it. I even bought the Deluxe Edition DLC just to give more money to the creators. I will 100% play this game many more times. An experience that left me on the edge of my seat for days on end. Choices in Act 1 really do make a difference in Act 3. I have many regrets in the first play through (Poor Minsc, I will come back for you) but the impact on the game from these mistakes make the game all the more worth while. A new experience in every time.",True
1086940,"Late to the review game on this because I was too busy playing it! It's the best D&D based game ever. The absolute best part for me is playing it with friends.  If it has in game communication, I don't know what that is (we just use phone to talk while playing and we can hear slight sync variances).  

There are the usual live server issues, some days more than others.   There are also some bugs/glitches, but you generally figure out how to deal with or compensate for them over time.  For me the most frequent and repetitive (in multiplayer mode) is that it wont display any conversation options when you know it should be (for the active of the two+ players), which then requires that you reboot the game and start from where the conversation was last saved to get those options to display for the character making the choices.

Separately, it does have an optional rogue or rogue-lite mode (only save is where you stop, death is permanent), which. if you complete it awards a special set of dice.  The award is minor, but that mode does have a 'feel' to it that is really cool, if you like that sort of challenge.  Given that the game is so huge and some of the bosses can be very challenging when you can not scum save, its good that this mode does have scalable difficulty.  

I would recommend that if you like this sort of mode that you play it before playing all the way through the story in the scum-savable mode because you can exhaust the story options and replayability easier in scum save mode, whereas in the rogue mode, each replay will open up more variability to keep things interesting.  Caveat to that may be to play for a bit in scum savable mode (till you have beat one or two bosses) just to understand the basic mechanics and threat levels before going rogue.  But otherwise, the rogue mode is pretty cool. 

Even if you normally don't like rogue mode (or have never tried it and think you would not), consider that tabletop D&D is basically played in rogue mode... unless you have a very forgiving dungeon master, you live with the consequences of all your choices.  So where I don't always like rogue games, here, it feels very true to the original gameplay and adds to the enjoyment in that way (for me. ymmv). 

Another thing to know is that if you choose a default character over a custom one, you are likely to get additional story lines tied to those characters.  Like for instance, playing as Gale, you will have his cat show up with gifts and conversation at times, where the cat is just set dressing if Gale is in your party as other than your main character.  So, this adds to replayability, too, getting to see what things come up that are unique to the pre-configured characters you choose to play.  Given that you can generously respec characters, this means you may want to try characters whose classes/races are not your usual thing, just to see what the story variations are (you can always respec them to your style).",True
1086940,"I spent a good 3-4 hours in the prologue area. Attempt after attempt at trying to kill the boss. ""He's optional,"" ""You don't have to fight him,"" Blasphemy, I tell them. It wasn't because I thought I had to fight him, I knew what I needed to do. So then, why? It wasn't so I could get his sword, not at all. It wasn't even for the achievement, far from it. It was because I could",True
1086940,extremly fun amazing story telling and INCREDIBLE freedom of choice,True
1086940,"God this game is great. Sure, as a result of the expansive ""lets try and give the player the opportunity to try anything they can think of"" attitude that went into it's design it can react a little funny to your choices at times but thats also the best part about it and I love it so much for it. 
Well done on every aspect. This game's creation is an insane achievement.",True
1086940,"WOW!
I have never played a game like this in my life. DnD was something I never thought to try but BG3 peaked my interest so I gave it a shot. The world was so expansive, the characters were interesting, the dice rolls were fun and exciting, and the story was incredible with every twist and turn. 
It felt like the characters were real and every decision I made had actual weight to it. The most incredible thing is that I talk with friends about this game and realize we had such different experiences that the re-play-ability seems endless. 
10/10 I would absolutely recommend this game to everyone and I expect to play a few more campaigns in my future!",True
1086940,"Incredible game continuing the story of the two classic Baldur's Gate games with a bunch of hot people. Unfortunately, the game is 1000 hours long.",True
1086940,"Worth full price easily. It runs good, it has modding support built in and just generally feels like a well made game.",True
1086940,One of the greatest games since early access. No other game in my opinion has been anything quite like it or as good.,True

1086940,"It's an RPG based on D&D, which I both play and GM. The characters are good, there's robust options for customizing your Followers in regard to their abilities, and I've had minimal trouble with bugs.",True
1086940,ive bought this game like 8 times on gog i have 1920 hours and 75 on steam do i really have to say is good even after 1 year of revisiting hits even hardewr ive never been obsessed with a game so much is perfect this and kowtor2 my fav games of all times,True
1086940,"I'm someone who doesn't play a lot of video games. I had a few PC games like Myst and Wolfenstein 3D as a kid, and I was a huge Rareware fan in the N64 days, but the most recent video game I'd gotten into before this was Final Fantasy X. Modern games and I don't really get along. I can't ever remember all the controls for each game, I forget what I'm doing and pieces of lore between sessions, the controls always feel overly sensitive, and sometimes FPS cams make me nauseous. Steam says I've dropped 1500hrs into Baldur's Gate 3. Steam doesn't always pick up my hours accurately, and it's closer to 2K. Two THOUSAND hours of my life, 20 years after I'd mostly stopped gaming, dropped into this game, and counting.

Larian has put a lot of time and love into this game, and it shows. The turn-based combat gives me time to think about my next move without pressure, which is great when I've been working long hours and my reaction time is worthless. The UI is very easy to understand and is both functional for beginners and has features for more advanced players. The camera moves confidently and doesn't feel jumpy. On top of 4 main difficulty modes, custom difficulty allows you to give yourself proficiency bonuses if you're super new and just want to experience the story, or give yourself negatives if you want more of a challenge.

The story is delightful, the worlds and cutscene cinematography beautiful, the companions engaging. Depending on how you play, you get to experience each of them in different ways, and of course each has their own playable story. I've often described Act 1 as a playable movie. You can rush it, but I feel the game rewards you for going slowly and taking your time to do everything. Larian has recommended playing as a custom Tav first before the companions or Dark Urge -- a customizable character whose story will be familiar to players of the previous Baldur's Gate games. IMO this is great advice, since the Urge can have quite an effect on how you experience the game, especially in Acts 2 & 3, even if you choose to resist it, but moreso of course if you embrace.

I've been playing on Steam Deck, but I've been inspired to build a new PC because of BG3, in anticipation of whatever Larian has coming next. Highly recommend this game and this company.",True
1086940,"Just from the sheer amount of dialogues, choices and scenarios that follow, you can easily tell that Larian Studios gave their best, even to minute details. To have this kind of game, where your choice actually matters and have consequences, and not just giving the illusion of choices is quite rare. The only downside is the woke element that clearly show in the later Act of the game, and cut contents that we won't likely get due to Hazbro's BS. Stories, characters could have been much better, if there was no woke influence and have they focused more on traditional style like they did in Act 1. Still it is a game of the decade for no doubt. I will happily recommend this game for anyone who wish to experience true Role Playing Adventure.",True
1086940,The best game in the world. I can´t verbally describe how much i love this game. This game is literally the reason i haven´t killed myself yet. 1000000000000000000000000/10.,True

1086940,"This is the most incredible game I have played to date. I have been a gamer since I could talk as a kid and no matter what I have played since nothing can compare. It is so good it has left a void in my heart since I finished my first play through. Nothing comes close to how much I love this game. It has everything I want in a good game, well written complex characters, engaging lore, incredible world building, romance and a detailed world to explore. Somehow every time I play it I still find something new, and even over 100 hours in I have no doubt I will continue to enjoy this game ten fold what I already have. If you are asking yourself ""Hm, well it's a bit pricey and I'm not sure if it will live up to the hype.."" Just do it. If you love fantasy get it. If you love DnD get it. If you enjoy video games get it. I have only the highest praise for this game and I would pay the same amount I did when it released now, or even five to ten years down the track. Rant over, this is picky gamer approved.",True

Character, world and story development is 10/10. 

The best RPG ever!",True

1086940,"This is an easy and clear contender for game of the decade and one of the top games of all time for me. I put 160 hours in just one playthrough, without grinding or doing repetitive stuff.

I keep having to run it back from the beginning because I have way too many mods and keep switching back and forth, which crashes my game, but I'm still addicted. Buy it. Just do it. If you regret it, well, er... idk. Bad taste? Skill issue? lol jk it's great.",True
1086940,"Game of the Year for a reason!

Tip for other newcomers: play on balanced or explorer first (dnd mechanics are...... complex), and for the most enjoyment really get into playing your main character rather than min-maxing, or looking for cheese builds.",True
1086940,"As close to the open-endedness of a TTRPG as it can get in videogame format, there's a lot of endings and choices that both make an impact on the story and the actual difficulty of the game, plenty of classes and subclasses many fans of the genre are already familiarized with, interesting plot, well-written characters, and beautiful sceneries solidify Baldur's Gate 3 as the best RPG released to date.",True
1086940,"After about 1100 hours in, the game is fantastic. It's just a really solid, well-built game that landed on top of the work Larian did with the Divinity franchise. The addition of more and more subclasses changes the entire way you can play the game. I have zero problems with the game and only desires for minor additions, but they are all just flavor, really, like adding more randomly dropped magic items and races.",True

1086940,"I like the freedom in this game, there is a plot-line for every kind of player. You want to romance someone - great, there are options. No - great, you aren't forced to partake. I recommend you play the dark urge plot-line. It added so much more depth to my character's lore, but also a layer of difficulty to the play-through - as dialogue becomes a focal point as apposed to just fighting/strategy. Sometimes, this game can be a little draining - especially if you aren't playing it the way you want. Take your time. Involve yourself with the characters and the world. Download mods if that helps. 

This game is 100% worth the price. And, I am 100% going to keep playing it throughout the future. Thank you.",True

1086940,"I love this game, all the story and different paths you can choose.",True

1086940,"It was not cheap. I buyed it with price 59,99€ - but it was worth it absolutely! 
Damn i was glad that i started it while i was at home for a while and had the time to slip into this world.
I'm not much into round based games but i got used to it. To be honest as an anxious gamer i appreciate this type of combat now because there is no time pressure or panic-brain-freeze. 

It was perfect for me that i waited over a year to buy it because now there are so many fixes and mods (i get them on nexusmods.com) so i can mod it to the perfect game for me. You can even mod spiders into dogs appearance for those with arachnophobia. Be aware that there are kinky/spicy scenes and romanes you can encounter if you want.

I love the interactions so much and the graphics are just stunnig. So many clothing and equipment possibilities! (To be fair you should tidy up you inventory as good as possible to not have chaos).

I highly recomment to follow the Motioncapture actors like Neil Newbon - who was the actor for Astarion - on social Media. It is so wholesome to watch these guys being funny, adorable and they even do DND based live-events where they explore as their figures.

I am very thankful to be now part of this heartwarming open community",True

1086940,"A very enjoyable game.  There are a couple of minor things they could have done away with, but nothing major.",True
1086940,i hesitated to play this game because of the turn-based combat.  silly me - it's one of if not the very best games i've ever played,True
1086940,"As of this review, I have over 100 hours in this game (possibly 20+ of those just in the character creator...), and I can honestly say there is easily another 100 hours of content available for me. Each time I start a new playthrough, I find something a new hidden secret or select a dialogue option that opens up a new path. The depth is INCREDIBLE. I feel like I'm going to be playing this game for years to come and loving every minute.",True
1086940,"I admit I was pretty late to the excitement of this game from when it initially came out in 2023. A good friend of mine bought me a copy so that we could play this game together, and it did take me a little bit of getting used to. But after enough time playing both by myself and with friends I can say hands down it's not only one of my favorite RPG experiences in recent year, but one of the quintessential PC gaming cornerstone.

As somebody who enjoys both single player experiences and things like tabletop gaming this game easily scratches both those itches and does so with ... one of those, uh... really nice wooden back-scratcher's that's satisfying to use. I know next to little about actual D&D lore, and even without that experience it does a great job at weaving a narrative that's not only easy to digest, but really helps you immerse yourself in the story it tells.

The game-play is a great blend of isometric adventuring and turn based combat, and dances the line between the two really gracefully. Even just beyond the player character, every member of the party you can acquire in the game you can customize to your heart's content to suit what ever manner of play style best suits what you're aiming for.

My biggest reason for wanting to write a review for this game though has to hands down be how wonderful the game's developers at Larian Studios have shown love for the game in it's many many updates. 

Multiplayer is a delight, and even more so the integration of cross platform compatibility AND an active and very sociable modding community whom Larian openly embraces. The togetherness of players and developers is something really rare to see--Even with other modding juggernauts like a lot of Bethesda's RPGs, there isn't such a truly unified community as what gold Larian's struck here.

This game without question for me is one to come back to over and over. Either by myself, or with friends. And the constant stream of new fan made content even after official updates creates nigh infinite replay-ability.",True
1086940,This is the best game I've ever played. It's like having an addiction but only paying once. I have played so many hours and yet I have not finish it and I feel like I'm losing information and scenaries and I'll need to play it again to discover more. I'm already planing how I'm going to play the next round and I'm not near ending this one.,True

1086940,Wow. Just wow. I am not a fan of turn based combat so I did not buy this game for a year. But when it was on sale and I was bored during Christmas... The first week was difficult because of the combat system. But more and more... Three months later my first run is finished and all I can say is wow. Used to play DnD many years ago and this game really has the same magic. The characters and voice acting is awesome. The story captivating. I love it. And have to start the next run now.,True

One problem i have with the game is that its too slow, i wish there was a 2X or 3X mode in combat because its excruciating to wait 10 minutes for some random rat across the map to dash.",True

1086940,"DISCLAIMER: I'm someone who prefers more 'theatrical DnD' that's made more for an audience in mind (ex: Dimension 20/NaDDPOD) as opposed to more traditional DnD experience with all the crunchi-ness that it entails.
Anywho, here's my review after beating the game with just under 100 hours on the save file and doing almost every side quest along the way:

Pros:
- Very robust character creation options
- Can even choose to play as characters that would normally be optional party members for a more concrete background and established story
- Choosing one class to play as doesn't perma-lock you out of other classes or gameplay experiences since there's a way you can change your class whenever you want during your play through without facing and real negative consequences
- The world [i]actually[/i] changes based on how you play, and not in small ways either. Different quests, characters, dialog options, and relationships can be unlocked or cut off based on how you play and what characters think of you, which gives a lot of replay value to make different choices and see what happens
- Combat is fun, flows well, and feels good to play
- You can pretty much play as any character you want with the different enchants you can find on weapons, armour, and jewelry
- The story is very engaging, and there's multiple ways you can go about finishing the game, with different end scenes based on how you played
- You can quick save, try something, and if it goes wrong you can just load the quick save and try again. Yay for easy retry system with no punishments!
- Several party members to recruit as you play for several different party comps that can change how fights work and even give different NPC interactions depending on who you have in your party, which also lends itself to encourage multiple play throughs

Cons:
- Outside of combat/direct story advancements it felt pretty slow. Sometimes it felt like a chore to start up the game and play for an hour to get to the parts I was actually interested in (probably just a me thing, see my disclaimer at the beginning)
- With the game being split up into three acts, the world you can explore as a whole isn't really that big. Acts 1, 2, and 3 area huge when combined, but individually it's not as large as it may seem. Can also be a good thing though to help keep the players from getting overwhelmed, but I found it a negative
- I have a standard laptop (not optimized for gaming or anything in any real way) but even playing with all the graphics on low quality it [i]still[/i] takes like 10 to load in a new area. Until then walls are invisible, textures are very polygonal, shadows don't exist, etc. I know I'm not using a high end gaming desktop or anything, but even with everything on low quality it's annoying that things still struggle to load on a decent standard laptop
- They have two dice skins you can choose from (unless you ordered a special version or beat the game on the hardest difficulty), which seems like such a wasted area since you roll the dice dozens of times each play session. You'll need to install some mods for custom dice if you want more
- Some weapon classes are favored more than others, having more unique weps with special enchantments/effects than others have (tons of swords, daggers, and great swords with hardly any flails, tridents, or handaxes by comparison)


TL:DR;
- The boss fights were great, I can't think of any that felt like a copy/paste of other fights
- The world changes to reflect how you play in meaningful ways, actually leading to numerous different dialogs, NPC interactions, and other plot points that really makes the choices you make feel like they matter
- Felt kinda slow outside of action/story moments
- The world map isn't as big as it seems, but still a good size to explore
- Had some loading lags, even with all quality settings set to low, which was annoying
- Definitely a fun game, will probably be playing it more in the future for some achievement hunting play-throughs

If you like DnD and videogames you'll probably love playing this game, whether alone or with friends. I'll give it an 8/10, would recommend.",True
1086940,"Started the game, got mind-flayed. 10 minutes later, I’m looting corpses, setting a goblin camp on fire, and somehow in a love triangle with a vampire and a demon lady. Standard RPG experience.

Pros:
✅ You can seduce a bear. No, really.
✅ Dice rolls decide your fate, just like real life. (Mostly failure.)
✅ Accidentally committed arson, nobody questioned it.
✅ Every conversation is either diplomacy or maximum war crimes. No in-between.
✅ Karlach exists. That’s it. That’s the pro.

Cons:
❌ I tried to jump across a gap and missed. Died instantly.
❌ Owlbear cub is cute, but will 100% eat your face off.
❌ My rogue failed a stealth check inside their own shadow.
❌ Accidentally romanced a certain dark elf. Now I sleep with one eye open.
❌ Lae’zel called me a pathetic worm, and I liked it.

Final Verdict: 11/10. Accidentally made enemies with a squirrel, now my whole party is dead. GOTY.

If you've been wanting to play D&D with friends but have long distances, a lack of DM, or you just want to learn the ropes on your own, this game is a great way to overcome those obstacles.

Everything is fantastic. The characters, the world, the music, the story. Replayability is off the charts. The dev's support the fanbase and mods, and even tho they've said they won't be putting out more DLC or anything else. They continue to put out new patches with new subclasses, crossplay etc. 

I could go on for days about how much I love this game.",True
1086940,"REALLY good game! The turn base fighting is a bit of a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it it's an amazing game with fantastic story. The voice acting is grade A. The multiple choices of paths you can take makes playing the game unique each time if you wanted to. Highly recommend this game if you have any interest in D&D. Even if you haven't played before, this is a good way to learn the basics and get used to the play style if you wish to eventually play tabletop.",True

1086940,"Everyone has already sung their praises on this game, so I'll just say what has blown me away the most is the voice acting. EVERY character and voice in this game is great, full of heart and emotion. I was not expecting for the VA to be top of my list. I dont know how they managed to get top tier voicing out of everyone but hats off to them",True
1086940,"I love the story, graphics, repeat play ability. This game holds a special place in my heart. Definitely recommend if you love TTRPGs as a whole and if you love DnD this game is worth it.",True
1086940,"Absolutely fantastic game. The story is engaging though gets a little ridiculous as the plot develops. All the characters are compelling. They did my girl Karlach dirty though and it always hurts me feelings thinking about it. The combat is refined and tactical. The freedom of choice is excellent. This is about as close to playing a real DnD game as you are going to get away from the tabletop.

Some things I didn't like though: There are story threads that the game doesn't really wrap up that are a big deal to the characters and get you invested. The devs don't want to do anything more with the game regarding those things they set up. That's disappointing because there is a lot of potential there. There is also a rushed feel to the polish of the final conflict of the game. It has a vibe like they were getting tired of making it and wanted to wrap it up. There were also some substantial bugs during my play through, especially regarding playing co-op with friends that were using Mac. There were times we couldn't even play. It might be resolved though. I played this game so much that I need to take a break from it for a while.

Overalll I give the game 5/5 and it is worth every penny it costs.",True

It has been quite a long time since I've played a single player game that got me hoocked like this one had. 

It's definetely worth the money, I can see myself going over 500h on this game alone!",True
1086940,"I have 280 hours in this game as of writing this review. A quarter of those hours is probably in character customization alone. This game is amazing both on Vanilla and Modded, it has an ingame mod manager that let's authors add their own twists and fun add-ons to the game and It's extremely easy to use. The turn based system is extremely fun and it let's you calculate your moves in so many different ways. The game has many different races and so many different classes to choose from which makes every single playthrough unique from the other, not to mention the way you choose to interact with the characters in the world affects how the world shapes around you. I always find myself creating a new save before I finish my first one just because the replayability is so fun and it makes me want to try different ways of interacting with everything. As of right now I have never finished the game and that's probably my own fault LMAO, I regret nothing, this game is truely amazing and by far the best game I have played as of 2024 and 2025. I shall keep fighting my inner demons and finish the game already and probably replay it another 50 times LOL",True

- Start with a long and interesting story

- Don't forget a lot of fun things to do

1086940,I finished my first playthrough a few weeks ago now and I loved every bit of it. Sometimes there was slight frustrations with character interactions or bad rolls but in a game with so many outcomes and options it makes sense for some to not mesh fully. All of the player characters are likeable with all of them able to synergize well in combat and in dialogue. It's an ambitious game with a lot of care put into it with updates for bug patching and public mods being added very recently. Although it's more expensive then a lot of other games the hundreds of hours of fresh content makes it worth it.,True

1086940,I loved playing this game. There are some bugs in act 3 but overall it was so fun to play something with good characters and story. It made me remember why I love to play good RPGs and putting in the extra effort of making the world believable makes a big difference. I wish there were more games like this out there but I know quality takes more time so I just enjoy the sh*t out of them when they come along.,True
1086940,"Best crpg I ever played, amazing that everyone is voice acted. Pillars of eternity brought the genre back but doesnt even come close to how finished and polished bg3 is. Looking forward to a few play throughs",True
1086940,"this is a game made with so much love and attention. even after its release, the developers are continuing to churn out major updates with game-changing aspects that have made replaying the game a necessity. at its release, it was a phenomenal experience, and over time it has only further improved by the devs granted players additional ways to connect with the characters, such as the options to kiss and to have additional cutscenes and dialogue. there is always something new to experience, no matter how many times you play through. my first playthrough, i played as a durge and romanced astarion. it was something like a religious experience, seeing this love unfold, learning about astarion's traumas and seeing him rise above and understand his worth as a person who deserves to live. his story in particular was one i deeply related to, and i am so thankful to those that took part in creating him for depicting trauma in such a raw light, and also for making the story between him and the durge so beautiful in how the two of them can heal from their wounds together. thank you, larian, for this magical experience <3",True

1086940,"one of the most story-rich, most immersive and prettiest games out there

love combat mechanics too, once you get the hang of it and start leveling up it's really fun, makes you feel so smart if you plan ahead and strategize to get the advantage over the enemy

1086940,"I like the dnd game. It is very nice. But please note: This game will suck the life out of your CPU if you don't have a cooler. Even playing it windowed with low graphical settings, my cpu climbed to 75-85C on average while playing, even going dang near to 95-100C at times. INVEST IN A COOLER or you'll kill your processor.",True
1086940,"I have always wanted to play DND. I never had people to play it with and never knew of the games that are basically DND. I always tried to play the tabletop online with people but never convinced anyone. Playing this game as my first DND (solo) experience was wonderful. I've played so many different RPGs throughout my life and I've always roleplayed the main character. Having the freedom to do many different this as these characters is the best part, while having a fun combat system. It's a great game, deserving of all the praise.",True
1086940,"This is simply the best role playing game that has ever been made. 

Cons:
It is not a perfect game by any stretch. The writing was oftentimes immature, naive, and maybe even cringeworthy at times. 
If you aren't a fan of turn-based battles, you may not like much of the combat.

Pros: 
STORY.  It is very easy to set aside the juvenile writing and enjoy each and every character in the game (not just your main party). Side quests are fantastic. The main quest is cogent and epic.
RPG development - you really can build whatever you want and develop into a powerhouse of whatever class you pick. The pacing of this is superb. They did a fine job not letting the game get too easy (though it does by the time you get done with Act 3 as your characters have a ton of power by then).
Soundtrack - I can't think of a game that sounded better than this game. The music is absolutely delightful, moving, and emotional. 
Voice acting - having everything voice acted really does make a huge difference in immersion.

This game was like playing out a D&D campaign with your favorite friends and an excellent dungeon master. Play this game. It is an all-time great.",True
1086940,So many choices and so much content. Perfect game to replay as every playthrough will be different.,True
1086940,Absolutely love this game! The fact it's like D&D is really interesting and fun! characters are cool and I love the art!,True
1086940,"This game is so good, I'm on my second playthrough and I bought i less than a month ago. The storyline is genuinly interesting and it adapts just the right amount of dnd mechanics. Also love that Jaheira and Minsc make a return <3",True
1086940,"This game is truly a journey. And not just in the epic fantasy RPG sense that it is, but for me this game has been an ongoing story in my life for 18 months. I've played it in bits and pieces from release, and on one save file through basically every patch ever made for this game. 213 hours on steam, 180 hours on the save file, and 18 months irl. 

It's made me laugh, cry, and rage. Both in writing, and in design - this game is absolutely fantastic but not without flaws either. Be warned, this game can be as long or as short as you make it to me. I made it long, and I don't regret that. But it can feel like you are lost at sea at some points, especially in the first act when the plot hasn't fully started yet and there are a thousand side quests between you and your objective. You start off with a group of vagabond weirdos doomed to die and you end up (hopefully) a group of friends bound by fate and heroic antics. 

Despite all of my complaints, I truly do love this game. And hopefully, you will too.",True
1086940,"Played BG1 and 2 after this, and my god was the writing better back in those days. I mean I actually found it fun and interesting to read the dialogues, and I often laughed out loud. (I played them alot growing up) BG3 and Larians style is just abyssmal, loud and obnoxious, clicheed and frankly boring. The moments where I think there are attempts at humour (?) were just so bad I wanted to uninstall. I had the same issue with DOS2. BG3s lack of charm also makes it overstay its welcome. By act2 I am exhausted by it, and act3 is spent rushing through to get it done. I've finished it twice, and had the same feeling both times. There is nothing charming about the game. Oh, and the game is too easy, too sexual, has too much inventory management, a really really ugly map system, and many many other irritating issues.

HOWEVER, the combat system is so much FUN. I know it is DnD5 rules, and Larians implementation of the rules makes for such a fun combat system. I cant wait for BG4, which is thankfully not going to be written by Larian. Hopefully they get back to the writing style of the good old games, but keeps the combat intact.

In summary, I played many hours and enjoyed them due to the combat system so I will give it a thumbs up, but dont be fooled that this is somehow a masterpiece - it isnt.",True
1086940,"BG3 is a masterpiece. It is the greatest game I have ever played, and will likely be one of the greatest I will ever play. The depth of the story and characters took my breath away, as well as the thousands of different stories you can tell by making different branching choices. Larian is a fantastic company that is still actively working to update and improve the game. No notes, just praise.",True
1086940,"This game is closer to Divinity: Original Sin 2 than the original Baldur's Gate games. As a fan of both I don't see that as an issue, but I think it's a good disclaimer to have. The DnD 5e rules have been adapted by Larian to work better as a CRPG, but they're still a bit weird when compared to the mechanics used in D:OS 2. In terms of story and presentation this is definitely an upgrade though. I do love this game, but I think my main takeaway from it is that I'm looking forward to D:OS 3, if it's going to combine D:OS 2 mechanics with BG3 levels of story and presentation.",True
1086940,"I've played since early access. The updates and patches since have done some incredible quality of life updates. This game blows you away. Even with all my hours and playing the different modes, there is absolutely no way I've uncovered everything there is to know. If you haven't gave in and tried it, and love RPG's, do it, give in, try it. And, if you play D&D, this is the most incredible visualization you'll find. 10/10",True
1086940,"∞/10
It's a game that in just a couple of hours of gameplay managed to drag me into a long adventure of 450+ hours, where each new playthrough can feel like a completely new experience due to the variety of choices. 

It is an incredibly interesting game, both in terms of its storyline: from the characters' stories that can make you truly sympathise with them, to the various dialogues with many options for replicas and responses to them. And the functional/gameplay component. 
This game made me both happy when I laughed at silly lines or situations I got into because of another ""critical fail"", but also managed to make me cry because of the truly painful stories of the characters. 

And in the end, I can't help but mention the MOST important thing that makes this passage even more enjoyable and understandable for perception: the full Ukrainian localisation, for which I am just incredibly grateful.

1086940,"I never loved and hated a game so much at the same time! The game overall is fantastic and has an amazing sense of freedom while still keeps you connected to the main story. Some battles (the reason why i hate this game) can be very challenging but the feeling of pure satisfaction you get after winning, more than makes up for it. The VAs did a fantastic job at REALLY bringing the characters to life and help the player connect with them and the rulles are simple for every player even if they are not familiar with DnD.

1086940,"40 hours in, still in act 1 (I'm approaching the end I feel but still not done all the Underdark or went to the Mountain Pass at all, probably will be like 45-50 hours for the first act). Act 1 is supposed to be 25% of the game... I have to travel a lot (work and holidays) starting in late September for like a month, I was expecting to be finished by then, but I'm not sure lol (and I don't like taking breaks in the middle of a game).

Also Starfield will likely not get playtime right at launch I think (I was expecting to be able to do BG3 and finish it around early September for Starfield time, would have liked to discover that galaxy with the community), will keep it for the December holidays now I think. because when I come back from my trip there's also Spider-Man 2 and AC Mirage. Have to squeeze Shadow Gambit somewhere there and I of course have some backlog (and Tears of the Kingdom too but I guess that's becoming backlog now) but I guess it won't move much in that time. Have to squeeze another playthrough of Cyberpunk with the expansion too.

I guess it's a good problem to have lol",True

1086940,"Baldur’s Gate 3 is a masterpiece. No other game comes close and I fear nothing ever will. The story, the characters, and the choices all pull you in and don’t let go. The world is alive in a way that few games ever achieve and the bonds you form stay with you long after you stop playing. I almost wish I could erase my memory just to experience it for the first time again. If that ever happened, I would beg someone to bring me back to this game.",True

For a game of this size and scope to have this much detail and complexity is nothing short of incredible. Not to mention the continued support from Larian years after release. I cannot say enough good things about this game. It is just one of the greatest games I have ever played period.

It truly is a must-play masterpiece and I eagerly look forward to Larian Studios's next game.",True
1086940,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ – Totally NOT Just Playing for the Hot Vampire

Oh wow, what a surprise. Another totally normal RPG where I start out as a brave adventurer, full of hope, only to end up committing crimes, making morally bankrupt choices, and falling for a pale, knife-happy vampire who absolutely wants to kill me.

Astarion? Oh, he’s great. A real sweetheart. The kind of guy who flirts with you one second and then casually reminds you he’d love to sink his teeth into your neck (but like, in a cute way?). My character is fully aware this man is a walking red flag, but do I care? Absolutely not.

The game itself? Oh yeah, it’s fine. The story is deep, the combat is strategic, and the world is full of immersive, meaningful choices—all of which I ignore in favor of trying to impress my undead boyfriend. I could be saving the world, but instead, I’m over here picking dialogue options that make Astarion smirk at me. Priorities.

Would I recommend this game? Hmm, let’s see. Do you enjoy heartbreak? Bad decisions? Astarion whispering sweet threats in your ear? Then yes, go ruin your life like I did.

10/10, would get emotionally wrecked by a vampire again.",True
1086940,"What is there to say that hasn't already been said? 

Aside from that I am a ""Villain protagonist"" enthusiast, this is probably the best villain protagonist experience I have had in an RPG game. It is unapologetic in the terror you inflict on others as a Dark Urge or just an unforgivably evil Tav. The creative freedom for roleplay is boundless in both villain and hero roleplays that allow for great dynamic villain characters. 

I simply wished there was more content that was exclusive to evil routes as being evil does come at a cost of losing storylines, compainions, questlines and loot. I wish there was more exclusively evil route things to offset some of the things we lose but there is no doubt still a lot of Evil exclusive content especially with the Dark Urge updates and I don't doubt my fellow Villain protag enjoyers will still enjoy the content availible",True
1086940,"Baldur's Gate 3 is nothing short of an absolute masterpiece. From the very first moments, I was captivated by its depth, rich storytelling, and the sheer amount of freedom it offers. The game perfectly blends classic RPG elements with modern mechanics, delivering an experience that feels both nostalgic and incredibly fresh.

The world-building is top-notch. The Forgotten Realms have never felt more alive, with every area filled with rich lore, dynamic characters, and meaningful choices that truly impact the story. The characters you meet along the way are some of the most compelling I’ve encountered in any game—each with their own personalities, struggles, and motivations. It's the kind of game where you genuinely care about your companions, and their fates feel just as important as your own.

What stands out the most, though, is the incredible freedom the game offers. The ability to make choices that truly matter, whether it's how you approach a conversation or the path you take through a dungeon, means that no two playthroughs are ever the same. The combat system is strategic and satisfying, offering a balance of tactical depth without feeling overwhelming, especially for newcomers to the genre.

The level of detail in the game is astonishing. From the intricate character customization options to the beautifully crafted environments, it’s clear that Larian Studios poured their heart and soul into this project. The dialogue, voice acting, and cutscenes are stellar, making it easy to get lost in the game for hours at a time.

Overall, Baldur's Gate 3 is a triumph. It’s an RPG that not only meets but exceeds expectations, and it's a game that I’ll remember for a long time. I couldn’t recommend it more highly to any fan of RPGs or anyone looking for an immersive, well-crafted adventure. My time with Baldur’s Gate 3 was an unforgettable experience, and I’ll be returning for many more playthroughs in the future!",True
1086940,"Honestly its kinda just peak, you know? Loyal to the original 5e ruleset though makes changes where necessary to help translate the DND experience into a game. Very well written characters and its very fun to watch the stories of all your companions play out. If you haven't seen any of this game yet or haven't played it, please do so before anything gets spoiled for you. Its incredibly fun to play from the beginning fresh without any knowledge on what can happen without the fear of getting 'the best ending'. Will say that Act III had simultaneously the most and least strong grip on me as while its still fun and primarily interesting to see your companion's stories wrapping up in mostly satisfying ways, it definitely feels like the two of the main bosses are shoehorned in too close to one another. Perhaps the game would have benefited from a 4th act, though I know it was in development for a long time so chances are if they were able to add a 4th act I'd imagine they'd have done so.

Overall incredibly fun. Didn't mention the mechanics but those as said are pretty similar to DND5e so chances are that if you like games and you like DND, you'll like BG3.",True
1086940,"The best game I have ever played.
I already love turn-based tabletop RPGs, but Baldur’s Gate 3—or rather, Larian—has managed to capture the magic of classic pen and paper and translate it into a truly unique game.

With this game, told through a three-act structure, Larian has created a one-of-a-kind gaming experience. I wish I could experience it again for the first time.

For me, Baldur’s Gate 3 is an 11/10, and I can’t wait to see what other bangers Larian will release in the future.

But no matter what comes next, Baldur’s Gate 3 will always be my absolute favorite game of all time.

Thanks, Larian!",True
1086940,"Incredible game, great story, cinematics, really great world. Love the assortment of enemies in the game, possible choices, as a DnD player, definitley a great way to spend time while not actually playing DnD, very very good game, would recommend 11/10!",True

1086940,"Long time dnd player, and this game was excellent. So much to do, and a great deal of customizability.  I haven't gotten into mods, but I understand it is very easy to do so. Amazing.",True
1086940,"Pros:
 - Some of the best writing and voice acting I've ever experienced in a game
 - Combat system is fantastically versatile, allowing you keep finding new ways to fight after hundreds of hours of play.
 - Game rewards strategy and attention to detail.
 - I think I may be in love with Shadowheart's voice actress.

Cons:
 - May not be for everyone. Level of choice is so great, people have complained of ""analysis paralysis"".
 - Can often feel like you are missing every attack. Regularly landing blows is part of the previously mentioned learning curve.
 - Requires patience during combat. Especially when there are a large number of enemies. Waiting for your turn can be stressful.

The slight tweaks and adjustments to the rules from 5e made me almost prefer this rule set. I have thoroughly enjoyed this game both with, and without my idiot friends. The mod community is also one of the best and most dedicated groups i've seen in any of the games i play. Absolutely worth every penny.",True

First off, the storytelling is phenomenal. You get completely sucked into this rich, detailed world with characters that feel so real, you'll actually care about what happens to them. The choices you make have real consequences, and it feels like you're shaping the story as you go.

And don't even get me started on the gameplay! The combat is strategic and satisfying, and there are so many different ways to build your character and tackle challenges. Plus, the world is massive and filled with secrets to discover, so you'll never get bored.

2: Story is amazing. It is such a gripping tale that you choose the outcome of! Ever since DA origins I have been in love with fantasy games where your choices matter. This game delivers. 10/10
3: Graphics. I have never seen or expected to see a crpg game with this good of graphics. It's seriously amazing. 10/10

The characters in this game are absolutely amazing they have so much depth and they can and do change throughout the story base don the choices you make or if you let them make their own choices! You can have a blank slate character with no special curse or whatever or you can be the Durge a customer character with a background or any of the origin characters all with deep back grounds and personalities. I am giving it a 9.5 out of 10 only because I like the characters from Dragon age a little better. 9.5/10
5: Depth. This game is the most ambitious project ever. You can tell they ahd to cut some content, looking at you upper city, and it is still deeper than any other video game i've ever played with the only rivals being divinity 2 (another larian game) or maybe the dragon age games which still don't have the depth to match BG3. 10/10
6: Cinematics. This ties into graphics ut they are amazing and needed a direct mention. 10/10. 
7: Customization. You can change the world, change your character, change your companions. enough said. 10/10
8: Romance. Again the dragon age games have been my favorite ever and they are the standard. The romances in this game feel deep and meaningful and they change the characters around you. I still think DA origins and DA2 went a bit deeper here but not by much. 9.5/10
Overall this game deserves every award its got and I absolutely love it.",True
1086940,"The best RPG ever made. A must play if you value games in which all your actions have consequences (good and bad) down the line.

",True
1086940,"This is a beautifully cinematic and challenging. Although, if like me you have never played this type of game before, don't be scared of the amount of stuff at the bottom, top, well everywhere on your monitor, because they hold your hand at the start, only getting more complicated with each level, but not so much that you notice it. The hardest part... obviously the choices you have to make and there consequences, but looking forward to next patch and going again. BUT PLEASE FIX ACHIEVEMENTS!",True
1086940,"Cool story, faster paced than similar games like this I have played. Tons of options.",True

1086940,Baldur's Gate 3 is an advanced roleplaying game with good multiplayer functionability. I have experienced very few bugs and the few I have experienced haven't affected roleplay at all. Very well made game and I expect a lot from the new update coming out soon!,True
1086940,"So, hands down in the Top 5 greatest RPG's ever made.
Like a newly renovated throwback to our RPG's of the early 2000's that had lore depth, voice acting, and world building as it's main attraction.
Throw in some modern quality of life enhancements like balanced power progression, stunning graphics, gratifying loot systems, hundreds of hours of content, and a general respect for the players time with a storyline that guides, but doesn't enslave you,  and you have what amounts to easily the best RPG in the last decade, but also a definite favorite for perhaps the best D&D themed RPG of all time (I'm thinking of you, Shadows of Amn).

People who don't even play RPG's love this game.
It gave you diversity and didn't sacrifice the integrity of the game to do it.
It was inclusive but not demanding
It chased complex political themes without preaching 

It does all the things other game companies tried to, but couldn't manage to pull off, while STILL creating a world everyone loved.

If you are someone who enjoys RPG's and have not played this game, then I present to you the gold standard that gets better with each play through.",True
1086940,Other games should strive to be more like Baldur's Gate 3 and give us a fully fleshed out game that doesn't require DLC to enjoy. I also love the DnD focus in this game as well. Game creators--- please make more bangers like this one!,True

1086940,"Doesn't really need my review. Game is fantastic, Larian is great. BG3 is epic! *mic drop*",True
1086940,"Master piece. 
Insanely deep mechanics, immersive story and world and lots of high quality side quests.
You can easily sink more than a 100 hours in this.

If anything you might get overwhelmed by the sheer amount of content and options.
As a new player it might take a while to get used to this game.

Also if you already love Dungeons & Dragons then you have to get this!",True
1086940,"What I liked: An incredible RPG! Worth every penny. A good time when playing with a couple of friends. The story is well written and highly detailed. Highly recommended!

What I disliked: Make sure to save often. Sometimes the dialogue options glitch out or the dice roll UI does not show up, especially when playing with other people.",True
1086940,"Everything you heard about this game is true. If you can tolerate turn-based gameplay, and are into investing a lot of time into a long, epic story, then this is an easy recommendation. 

I give it 5 Nat 20s!",True
1086940,"An amazing RPG! Can literally get lost in this world for hours and on! Astounding music and diverse gameplay scenarios which always keep you on your toes and makes you wonder what shall happen next! 

One word to describe it would be BRILLIANT!",True
1086940,as a beginner for playing pc games vs traditional systems ; i would say so far this is my favorite game since transitioning into pc games!,True
1086940,"""I'm pretty tired of fantasy games..."" I say as I finish my first play through after 190 hours and immediately start a Dark Urge campaign. Great RPG, love the official mod support, really love the mechanics of the game that allow it to be a true 4 player game, even if you're the only one playing.",True
1086940,"If you like the talking to characters and making dialogue decisions in skyrim, then this game is for you because it's just like that x1000",True
1086940,LOTS to do and details to find- I'm at 325 hours across 3 concurrent playthroughs with different player characters and difficulties. I haven't even finished a run yet. Has built in mod support!,True
1086940,"Short answer. This game is a lot of fun. If you're into RPGs you should give it a try.

Longer answer. First play through I got a little into act 3, but had skipped so much that I was really under leveled and decided it was just easier to start over. I finally got a second run all the way to the final boss and one of the cutscenes crashed the game. I looked everywhere for answers and couldn't fix it. I think it was a mod, but even disabling the mods didn't fix it. That 60 hour run is just dead. Then I just kept getting distracted making new characters and have about half a dozen runs somewhere in act 1 and 2. Finally at about the 300 hour mark I finally got back to the end boss and didn't have a game ending bug. The fact that I just kept wanting to play the game after all the frustrations tells me all I need to know. This game is just a lot of fun.",True
1086940,"Great game with great graphics and a great story. Very detailed dialogue options that lead to different outcomes. A huge selection of spells and abilities + classes to choose from.

Coming here from DOS2, I have to say that I still prefer DOS2's combat + armor system. The D&D rng/dice roll in this game ruins a lot of the combat for me. Imagine having to roll a dice to hit someone point blank and you miss. Or roll a dice for dialogue options, or to picklock something...you get the point.

But it is still a great game so far.",True
1086940,"absolutely  love this game, it can be difficult at times, but it more than makes up for it with its vast world and gameplay options (i do hope that larian improves dragonborns, though! they can be pretty basic with their race benefits :/)",True
1086940,"I never played a game like this before and I usually don't like this type of game.
But let me tell you, the first time I tried this game at my friend's place, I played it for 2 hours straight and enjoyed it a lot.
After that, I knew I had to buy the game.
The game itself is amazing, fun, full of advanture and surprises.
There is lore and something to explore at every nook and cranny.
I have about 100 hours in total in my first playthrough (it says 80 hours but it's wrong).
And I never finished those 100 hours faster than this, this was amazing and if I could erase my memory and do it all again, I would.
This is an unique game that you can see is a love child from Larian Studios.
I recommend this game to anyone and everyone who considers themselves a gamer because this game was a perfect hidden gem for me, and it might be for you too.",True
1086940,"The real villain of TTRPGs is Time. In TTRPGs, it's scheduling with players. In this game, it's the fact that I am addicted to eventually 100%ing this game. It's so good, and I am hooked.",True
1086940,"Seeing how this is my night wind down game. Of course I love it. The mechanics are amazing, easy to learn, and the more you play the more you understand. It's almost always different everytime you play and it's amazing. Though I keep romancing gale I can't say no to him.",True

1086940,"A very immersive game with lots of little secrets and pathways to find! I swear, I find something new with EVERY playthrough I finish, and it just keeps pulling me back in for more. Plus, with the added mod support, I really don't think you will grow bored of this game (especially with all of the updates and patches). Overall, its a great game, and I really enjoy playing it!",True

It's just a fantastic game that's pretty much perfect in what it intends to do and tries to be. I'm leaving a review to feed the more than well deserved overwhelming positive reviews.",True
1086940,"This game, is honestly one of the best RPG's in my personal opinion out there. The only thing I can flaw, is I do wish that there was some more guidance. First time I played it, I did it in the wrong order. But I do understand, that it's more abut your characters different journey. The visuals for this game are beautiful, I've hardly had any glitches. Compared to the other games, this does feel like it has some depth to your own character. Creating a back story and becoming someone actually in the game and not a lifeless body.  The stories of the characters are so in depth, that even if your not interested in their story. You will be. Being able to play this game over and over again with hundreds of different choices you can make. Not alot of games have that these days. But this one does. I can not recommend it more.",True
1086940,"Still some bugs which is unfortunate for a game that has such a large fanbase, but aside from that I loved it. COMPLEX GAME. I'm very grateful my partner could kind of help walk me through it because character creation and classing is quite confusing without prior DND knowledge. But it was a great game, I recommend.",True
1086940,"Baldur's Gate 3 has become my favorite game of all time! I have put over 400 hours into it on Playstation, and when I built my first gaming PC, I knew it needed to be one of my first purchases. The story is very good, and offers a lot of player choice. Gameplay is the tried and true D&D combat, mixed with CRPG exploration. There is a lot of player customization, and you will find yourself being sucked into the world, and planning your next playthroughs. This game is well worth the money, and I believe everyone should give it a try.",True
1086940,"Oh boy, where to start...

This is my favourite game since Dragon Age: Origins and easily ranks in my top 5 RPG's of all time and likely one of the best games released in the last decade, it deserves every ounce of praise and every award it's ever received, after multiple playthrough's to gather all the steam achievements and every ending, it just doesn't get old.

The tactical combat is fun, intuitive, and it feels great to set up combo's and positions and you have complete freedom to set up whatever party composition and synergy you would like, it's really easy to make each playthrough feel unique and that freedom also applies to resolutions for quests and encounters, I've done 5 play throughs and I've never really resolved a situation the same way multiple times, I'm still figuring out and learning new ways to win and discovering things I hadn't in my prior playthroughs.

The dialogue and story writing are excellent and this is all complimented by a great cast of voice actors, big shout outs to Bae'zel, Shadowheart and Astarion on that front. It all feels natural and well put together, it doesn't feel ""Gamey"" and written like HR was in the room (Subtle stab at another game you may or may not know about) you WILL enjoy this game if you enjoy RPG's and story games.",True
1086940,"Super amazing game, the story line and quests are all so well thought out. Genuinely a must play.",True
1086940,"Editing this review. I had previously given the game a reluctant ""do not recommend"" based on a frustration with the game becoming unplayable on Act 3. I remain frustrated that this happened, but I have since determined that the issue was with one of the mods I had downloaded from the in-game mod list. I remain frustrated that I had to start over, but in all honesty I would have probably played the game multiple times anyways. I am now in Act 3 with no issues. 

While no game is perfect, this game is beautiful both in graphics and in story. It is the most replayable game I have ever played due to how heavily your choices impact the story line. It is as true to DnD as any electronic game could be in my opinion. (at least until/unless AI progresses to the point that it can truly take the place of a human DM)",True

Fantastic game though, for real 10/10",True
1086940," An actual masterpiece. More of something akin to an art installation when you realise the level of detail and care put into this piece. You could look at it for hours, like me, and always continue to discover new things. 10/10",True
1086940,"Game's good. Good combat, good story, good sound, good graphics, good character design. Can't put it down.",True
1086940,"My opinion Overall.
There probably will not be, anytime soon or perhaps ever another game that gives you the amount of Quality/Quantity, this game delivers in content, replay-ability, character development, story, and attention to detail in its genre of games. Hell, in all games in general.
Obviously made by people who play, love, and know what the people who play this genre of game expect, and want. BG3 by Larian Studios set the bar impossibly high. I'm spoiled by this game, and it has only diminished the joy of other RPG games, because my expectations are now so much higher, and most game companies aren't willing to deliver the grand experience this game has given me. 
I have over 100 hours in my first campaign alone, and am still finding new content in my 2nd and 3rd campaigns. 
Buy once and Enjoy for ever, all content and future content is free. Rare these days indeed, most companies want to nickel and dime you for everything. 

In its Genre of Games a 10/10
In Games in General a   9.5/10

1086940,"this is hands down one of the best games ever created. if you like fantasy style games buy this you WILL NOT regret it. on a side note the character reactions and facial expressions are super fine tuned and realistic, this is the first game i've ever played where i found myself laughing out loud at some of of the many responses and facial reactions your character will have. ABSOLUTEly ;) beautifully developed game, and this is just the vanilla experience",True

1086940,"That s the first time than I play a game like that. I don t know how is call. Anyways. I really love this game, It deserve his high price. The landcape, graphism are really pretty. I don t forget character for sure they r really well made. (Thery are  pretty and handsome (well not handsome like they are attractive lmao, the voldemort's wife for sure lol). Anyways. Really pretty landscape and character. The story is really good. It s my frst time in game like that so... I don t really like dices. If u know what I mean. BUT I don t know if I choose always the wrong quest, this game is really hard. Im in balanced. I always lose and die because my stupid character get bad dices. I hate gobelins.AND this game is not optimise. TYhe game tell me than I can play in Ultra, and when I play, my pc is turning down by overheated... I have to play this game in medium... That s a shame.",True
1086940,"Lives up to the hype so far. Very intense combat with a story that sucks you in, which to is to be expected of those at Wizard Coast.",True
1086940,this game is great and full of content. endless possibilities,True
1086940,"This is the best RPG and perhaps the best... game of the 21st century so far. I have never put so many hours into a game without feeling like I've wasted time, but this game NEVER leaves me feeling like I've wasted time.  It is gaming artistry.",True
1086940,One of the few actually good games released this decade. What a masterpiece.,True
1086940,great storyline and game play,True
1086940,This game breaks all other games for me! It's so creative and complex. Countless things to discover and ways to play each play through. Seriously worth every penny.,True
1086940,"i must admit im generally not a fan of top down experiences but larian did a great job with the console view so it made it easier for me to get into the game, after about 3 hours remaking my character lol, i got really into the game and im loving it so much",True
1086940,"This game is amazing. Between the wide customization options, the multiple story routes, and just how they listen to their fan base with each update. 10/10",True
1086940,"This is a long game. It took my full 130-ish hours of playing to complete one playthrough. At some point in the future, I will gladly invest that much time again to complete another playthrough with an entirely different build, but not right away I think. 

I loved the characters in this and, much like my time with Persona 5, I found that the length of the game made the entire cast come to feel like friends by the end. 

The mechanics are solid and well implemented, and I had a lot of fun coming up with creative solutions to problems and seeing how the game would react to that. The amount of detail that's packed into a fully 3D world here is genuinely astonishing, and I'm so glad to have got to enjoy it spoiler free.",True
1086940,"Plays great on steam deck. Nothing bad to say about it but I do think the D&D holds it back, I kinda wish it was divinity original sin 3.",True
1086940,"Riveting adventure, wide range of playstyle options, and a superior story are what make Baldur's Gate 3 one of the best games I have ever played. Be prepared to be engrossed in a narrative for hours on end - and for it to only feel like minutes. The voice actors, animation team, and game developers all deserve a standing ovation for the quality of work they put into this game. Highly recommend for anyone looking for the perfect D&D adventure.",True
1086940,unreal graphics. amazing storyline. worth every cent,True
1086940,"I've sunk 40 hours in one playthrough to not even be done with act 2, most fun I've had with a game.",True
1086940,"SImply the best game I've ever played. My first time playing this style of RPG, and I'm blown away. 10/10.",True
1086940,"This is for sure one of the best games I've played. As for the character depth, game plots, surpising twists, character mimics and voicing, it is absolutely stunning. The pathing of the character can be sometimes clanky but that just a minor thing easy to forgive. As for the fighting itself, I did prefer DOS 2 a bit with the usual cooldown system. 

Anyways.... Good.... GOOOOOOOOOOD job Larian!",True
1086940,"I LOVE THIS GAME. every character is unique, even the NPCs you meet along the way that gives you side quest! I went having high expectations and when I finally finished it, EXPECTATIONS WERE STILL HIGH!! I knew I was going to play it again the 2nd time ><. The story was wonderful, had every choice for almost everything (which I like) and the different endings to achieve, aaahh!! not to mention the secrets around the map and stuff, I'm yet to figure them all out. The combat was super fun too, but I'd admit it stressed me tf out at times HBDJHABJHBSAHA but still, I loved it all!! This game was super worth it and I'm willing to play it all over again :D",True
1086940,"Good game, but getting sick and tired of the repeated crashing on the macbook version.  Crashes more or less every hour or so.",True
1086940,"Excellent story, gameplay, music and characters, and no intrusive DRM to boot. Worthy of its 2023 GOTY title.",True
1086940,"Peak game, was able to snag it for 20% off and given how good it is, I shouldn't have waited to get it and bought it full price. The story, characters, and all the different possible characters the player can make allow so much room for roleplay it's amazing.",True
1086940,"This is honestly one of the best games I've ever played. I rarely replay games that are this long, as I want to move on to the next one, but I've done 2.5 play-throughs and they've all been quite different. There are so many ways you can play, so many types of characters you can be.  The turn-based combat style is not for everyone, but I like it as it allows you to be quite strategic.",True
1086940,Amazing storytelling and gameplay. A must have game for any D&D fan.,True
1086940,Only game that has kept my attention thus far. Love it & keep coming back :),True
1086940,"This game is an incredible successor to its predecessors, offering an immersive experience that feels like a genuine Dungeons & Dragons session. It's a blast to play with friends, fostering camaraderie and excitement. While the camera controls can be a bit finicky, and using a controller presents some challenges, these minor drawbacks don't detract from the overall awesomeness of the game. Overall, it delivers an engaging and memorable experience that fans of the series and D&D enthusiasts alike will thoroughly enjoy.",True
1086940,"One of the greatest RPG games ever.An epic adventure with your pals or yourself alone.Thanks to Larian Studios,The Divinity:Original Sin 2 was a legend, and Baldur's Gate 3 is a better one ledgend worth of 10/10.If u are looking for a game u wanna spend much time on it, purchase Baldur's Gate 3.",True
1086940,This is the first game I've played like this. Def a learning curve but the game is addictive so I caught on fast. I can see myself playing this over a couple times!,True
1086940,other then the price its an over all great game with fun combat and story,True
1086940,"Literally my favorite game of all time. Came here cause of the pretty vampire and stayed because of the most amazing game I've ever played. The soundtrack, the art, the plot, the side quests, the diversity in play-throughs, and THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL!!!! 100/100 I love this game with my whole heart; catch me with hundreds of hours because this game is peak. I am so happy with this game and would recommend it to anyone who wants to have their soul sucked into a digital world with an experience that can never be replicated.",True
1086940,Finally made it out of character creator. Having an amazing time. 10/10,True
1086940,"One of, if not the best game I've ever played. I hope that we get more D&D style games with such an awesome story and function.",True
1086940,"I spent nearly 130 hours in Baldur’s Gate 3, and honestly? I still feel like I barely scratched the surface — and I loved every second of it.

This game has everything:
✅ Talking brains that give better advice than my friends
✅ Companions with more drama than a reality show
✅ Dialogues so good I actually read them (crazy, I know)
✅ And choices... oh, the choices. I second-guessed my life decisions more in this game than in my actual life.

Exploring the world, stumbling into weird secrets, and accidentally setting half my party on fire — all part of the charm. The story, the characters, the sheer chaos — it’s perfection.

If you like your RPGs deep, hilarious, heartbreaking, and occasionally unhinged, this is the game. 10/10, would romance a vampire and regret nothing.",True
1086940,"Super fun. True RPG. Makes you actually use your brain, skills, luck and chance to decide many of multiple ways to make it through. Fully customizable. Play how you want with the characters you want.",True
1086940,"Fantastic, and epic. Brimming with content, yet somehow still managing to be consistent and considerate of any sort of things happening. With great writing and companion-heavy influence, it really is engaging and impactful. It also manages the progression quite well, while allowing you to live that power fantasy fairly early on, being as powerful as you can.

Of course, considering the enormous openness and scope of the game, there are some small issues here and there - but it's never anything big, and in the grand scheme of things absolutely inconsequential. It all works really well, and really does deserve a big praise.",True
1086940,"+The story is immersive
+The graphics are great
+The acting is good
-5th ed sucks,
I wish we had the exact same story, graphics, and acting but with 2nd or 3.5 ed rules, one can dream!",True
1086940,"Out of all the games I have spent money on and have played over and over again. It is by far one of the most solid, enjoyable, and replayable game I have played. I recommend that anyone that has the money to buy and play it, if you don't have the money go beg or rob someone for it because this game is worth it. Good Luck and hope you guys enjoy it more than me.",True
1086940,Literally one of the best games I have ever played. It has some faults. Even those are amazing.,True
1086940,"This won game of the year for a reason; this is absolutely in my top 3 games of all time. Super fun and challenging battles, graphics and overall visuals are amazing, and the story is so enthralling and immersive. Not to mention fantastic character writing and voice acting. If you enjoy games like Mass Effect or Dragon Age then you will likely love Baldur's Gate 3.",True
1086940,"This game is the one that comes the closest to 5e dnd. if you like role playing strategy games, then you cant get any better than this. The story is well created, same with the characters, and the gameplay almost never gets boring, and thanks to the mod manager, you can play the game however you like. give it a try!",True
1086940,An absolute must-play for any gamer who enjoys adventuring and D&D mechanics.,True
1086940,"Honestly one of the few games I keep coming back to, the characters and their storylines are SO rewarding, along with the way things can change so drastically between playthroughs",True
1086940,actually so fun and i'm so addicted to this game... i'm still on my first run but i'm already planning my future runs. there's so much content to explore and choices you can make. i've never played real dnd before but BG3 is so fun that it makes me wanna try the real thing too. definitely recommend if you can spare the time as you'll need a lot to fully enjoy!,True
1086940,"Baldur’s Gate 3 is every bit as good as people say, but it does take some getting used to—especially if you’re not familiar with Dungeons & Dragons mechanics. The learning curve can be steep, and at times, it might even feel frustrating. But once things start to click, the game becomes seriously engaging, and it’s hard to put down. If you stick with it, it’s well worth the effort.",True
1086940,One of the best games I've played in a while. The multiplayer option is amazing for playing with friends. ACT 1 is so big I still haven't made it to the next act.,True
1086940,"Amazingly replayable, and honestly the greatest game I have played for the genre.",True
1086940,"While the plot is contrived and full of macguffins, the acting is top notch and production value overall is stellar - it manages to invoke emotions despite poor writing. The best aspect however is the game mechanics. It's fun, allows for a multitude of playstyles, and every problem has multiple solutions. 

I was somewhat afraid that the game would indeed be ""woke"", in the sense that diversity would be an excuse for poor writing and gameplay value overall. While writing is a definitive weakness, the so called ""woke"" aspect is not forced, makes sense in the contex, and it's a good game regardless.",True
1086940,"10/10 game, Loved everything about it. scratched an itch i have had for a long time, looked for so many games and this hit the nail on the head in so many ways. 100%'d the game and still play it, can't say that about many games. still finding more and more areas and missed content after several play throughs.",True
1086940,"I bought me and my buddy this game due to the outrageously good reviews, and a bit of nostalgia since I owned the original Baldur's gate. In the 140 hours or so I've played I can tell you it never felt like we ever had more than an hour of playtime, yet we would play for 8 hour sessions regularly on our days off. Every time I play this game i have the time of my life, Dnd brought right to your living room for a good price. Buy this game today and you will never regret it!",True
1086940,"if YES were the only thing required to type. Just YES. its wonderful. story driven. ive put 10 hours in, and honestly hardly scratched the surface. it says xx amount of playtime. id say you have almost infinite playtime if you listen to the story, play the mechanics, and full heartedly enjoy the game. Even if you speed ran. you'd still have a good time.",True

1086940,Great game with fantastic story lines and options for replay.,True
1086940,Big fun with tentacles with so much replayability. With tentacles. 10/10,True
1086940,Great game to play over and over finding new things that i didnt discover in previous playthroughs,True
1086940,I have barely got past the character creation and first few hours of the story yet and I know this is one of the best games I've ever played. I can't wait to get fully lost in this world.,True
1086940,"True to tabletop games, this brings the magic of playing with dice to the future of now. It is incredibly engaging, very long (which is nice compared to a lot of games that end quickly), responsive to your decisions (the story changes based on what you do so there are multiple ways to play) and INCREDIBLY versatile. I barely have time for games, but when I do, this is always where I go.",True
1086940,"Really great game, reflects reality incredibly with its realism. After multiple play-though's done I've finally got the hardest achievement of all done... Become a successful musician.",True
1086940,"Baldur’s Gate 3 is the best approximation of the classic Dungeons and Dragons experience available in video game format. As a game I loved so dearly while playing, I will surely continue to mess around with it for years to come. With exceptionally deep role-playing opportunities, complex and interesting combat mechanics, wonderful visuals, and great writing, Baldur’s Gate 3 is now counted among my favorite games ever. The bar has been raised for what is possible in the AAA role-playing space - let’s see if anyone can ever match it.

1086940,"It's been a while since I've found a game that has captured my attention this hard. Such a good game and great story, not even in Act II yet and I'm hooked.",True
1086940,Game a once in a generation game. This will go down in history as the game that saved the campaign style gaming. It has so many customization characters and settings yet it also manages to let you get wrapped up in this world of adventure like have never experienced from a game before.,True
1086940,"Just the fact that Baldurs Gate 3 occupied almost 3 months of my life to complete this amazing game shows the level of care and detail that Larian Studios put into this game.

I never thought I would enjoy the genre of isometric CRPG's but this game has impacted my life and has opened a whole new level of story telling and decision making. 

I rarely consider games to be a 10/10. But this game easily deserves it.",True
1086940,"I can't believe how much fun this game was - it genuinely exceeded every expectation I had, and I think it's hands down the best game to come out in the past 20 years. No other game has every so thoroughly captured my free time quite like BG3, aside from my heyday of playing WoW. Truly an iconic and incredibly replayable experience. 15/10 stars!",True
1086940,"A very unique and interesting experience. If you are like me and have always been interested in DND or TTRPGs, but have never played them, this is a really great introduction IMO. I've heard it isn't a true DND experience from my friends who play DND, which i dont doubt, but I have enjoyed every moment so far, and the same friends who say this, play the game and enjoy it just as much! For me, it also scratches that open world Skyrim type game itch i've had for a while and I find the game just extremely satisfying to play and SUPER enjoyable to play with friends. I cant recommend this game enough, especially if you have other people to play with.",True
1086940,"Very steep learning curve, but is very fun when you have a better understanding.

I have had the most fun when doing a playthrough with friends.",True
1086940,"""Adventuring... or Just Trying to Impress a Vampire?""

Started Baldur’s Gate 3 expecting an epic RPG adventure. Ended up treating it like a dating sim with occasional combat.

✔ Persuasion checks? Failed. Often.
✔ Accidentally setting things on fire? More than I’d like to admit.
✔ Reloading a save because Astarion didn’t approve? Every. Single. Time.

At this point, I’m less concerned about saving the world and more about keeping my emotionally unavailable vampire boyfriend happy. Priorities.

10/10 would ignore main quest for companion approval again.",True
1086940,"amazing RPG.  Huge world, multiple and complex story lines make this DND inspired game truly a gold standard for the genre.  I love the art and graphics.  I would recommend this game to those who are interesting in starting DND.  Happy Gaming!",True
1086940,Really fun game. I'm enjoying the story line and the combat so far. :),True
1086940,"Love this game, the story is immersive, all the characters are unique and not morally one-dimensional, the visuals are beautiful, the combat is tactical and there's a complex magic and item system. Every time I play this game I find out something new!",True
1086940,"Fun, complex story line. Lots of room for replayability.",True
1086940,We've been playing as a group of 4 for 80 hours now and the game still keeps delivering.,True
1086940,"A great RPG game to play through 1 to 3 times. Also playing co-op with a group of 4 friends is a beautiful and hilarious experience.
The gameplay and combat is great, I love trying different character builds and every combat encounter is brilliantly designed.

The story and characters are the bad side of the game. All characters are weak, emasculated, gay, whiny or depraved and unhinged. 
The story is not properly paced nor well incorporated into the rest of the game. It's an okay motivator to go on until you see that it's all just on paper and is of no import and influence to your gameplay style and decisions.
There's little room to actually roleplay, since you'll miss out on most of the content if you try to roleplay as a bad person, and everyone will constantly try to chide you and parent you out of doing it.

In summary, a great game engine and system, wish they would've worked on some expansions or different stories inside it, since this one is not so great.",True
1086940,"Great game. Buy it and play it with a friend. Yours truly, Morgan Mark Freeman Wahlberg.",True
1086940,ngl this is the best story driven characters in a game ever,True
1086940,"Well first and the most desisive ting i like its tha fack that has mods and a big comunity that make play troght very diverent. but theres also the fredom of duing whatherver you whant but also giving consecuenses to your actions. Also the fact that you can play with other with each they own character make the game more challengin and fun, since eniting can happen.",True
1086940,You can kill anybody you want. Most decisions count. Easily the best Baldur's Gate game based on gameplay alone.,True
1086940,An amazing game.   I can't recommend it enough.,True
1086940,"Graphics 10/10
Gameplay 9/10
Story 10/10
Best game ive ever played one playthrough was 250 hours for me i was super invested able to tune the game to your needs easy and story focused or grueling battles a true master peice",True
1086940,its a game ive wanted to play for a bit and its just as amazing as i thought it would be,True
1086940,DOS2 has more interesting companions but the combat in BG3 is a huge improvement.,True
1086940,"amazing game, i've come back to it several times and i still find new stuff.",True
1086940,I normally am not interested in games with a long story. Yet here we are.,True
1086940,great story telling with many paths through the story for replayability,True
1086940,"Baldur’s Gate 3 is an absolute triumph in the RPG genre! The game delivers a perfect blend of deep storytelling, intricate character development, and a world full of choices that truly matter. The voice acting is phenomenal, making every interaction feel alive, while the writing is some of the best I’ve encountered in a game.

The combat system, based on D&D 5e rules, is challenging but rewarding, offering plenty of opportunities for strategic thinking and creative problem-solving. Whether you’re exploring the vast world, engaging in tense battles, or experiencing personal character arcs, everything feels polished and thoughtfully designed.

The world itself is stunning, with every area filled with secrets to uncover, NPCs to interact with, and quests that can go in unexpected directions depending on the choices you make. The attention to detail is astonishing, and it’s easy to lose yourself for hours at a time.",True
1086940,Great game loved the characters and character customization is very fun.,True
1086940,"Played on release beat game 60 hours or so, Did most things however killed the lizard. Came back for 2nd playthrough not killed lizard. Found new things. Game is great. Spent about 30 hours in act 1 and just got to act 2 on 2nd play. The game is worth the price tag and is lengthy however ignore the people saying it took 60 hours for act 1, complete bullshit they are waffling. Game is easily beatable main+sides 50-80 hours. I have 150 hours because I have the problem of restarting over and over again and not being happy with my char LMAO. Probs spent more time creating new chars than playing. 100% recommend. Well worth the price and is worth more than all these so called AAA games being released for £100 lmao. Larian is probably one of the best game companies out there if not the best for sheer value and quality.",True
1086940,"10/10. Up there with Cyberpunk in terms of character writing, exceeds New Vegas when it comes to player choice, outstanding tactical gameplay if you are into that sort of thing. I can't say I've played a better RPG. Baldurs Gate 3 is a game that is so good that it ruins other games for me - I can't image playing something that isn't this high in quality.",True
1086940,"fantastic game, had it a little over a month and have lost nearly 100 hours to it
can't wait for the next play through
10/10",True
1086940,"Easily in my top 5 greatest games of all time. I can't bring myself to do an evil run but even doing basically the same goody two shoes runs again and again, I see new content every playthrough, and am constantly surprised by the possible actions and their permutations that Larian specifically accounted for. You'd be hard-pressed to do something they didn't have a contingency for built-in.

I very very rarely buy AAA games, or really anything over $30. This game could've been double the price and I'd have happily paid it knowing just how much enjoyment I'd get out of it. 

Overall, I highly recommend if you like very deep and complex RPG's in general, especially if you already have an affinity for Dungeons & Dragons. The rules can be a bitch to learn if you aren't already familiar, but the game does a pretty good job explaining things.",True
1086940,its a great game that has a really fun turn based combat machenic and great dialog writing,True
1086940,The Game of Thrones of RPG games. Nothing more to be said. A gaming achievement unlike any other.,True

Is very fun to play with friends or alone.",True
1086940,This games really fun but has a more relaxed feeling while playing. feel like a game of dnd :) im loving it,True
1086940,"It was the first turnbased game I ever played, I was scared to try it at first, but after I tried it I quickly grew fond of the game, the characters, the visuals, the story are all things I loved about the game. I dare recommend it to anyone who is just getting into the genre.",True
1086940,"Very fun RPG. I played and beat it on Tactician difficulty. I struggled at first, but once I got a better understanding of the D&D systems and how to take advantage of certain game mechanics, it became easy to cheese a lot of encounters (which I enjoyed doing). Though I will say, I enjoyed Divinity Original Sin 2 (by the same devs) more than this game. I reccomend to check that game out too, if you enjoy this one.",True
